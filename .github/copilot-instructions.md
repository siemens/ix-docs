# Copilot Instructions for Siemens Industrial Experience Docs

## Project Overview

- This repo documents Siemens Industrial Experience (IX), an open-source design system for industrial software UI/UX.
- Docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (see `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`) and use Markdown for content in `docs/` and `blog/`.
- UI component documentation is organized under `docs/components/`, with each component in its own folder and an `overview.md`.
- Custom plugins (e.g., `plugins/figma-pictures/figma.ts`) extend Docusaurus for design asset integration.

## Architecture & Data Flow

- Content is mostly static Markdown, auto-generated API docs in `docs/autogenerated/`, and custom scripts in `scripts/` for asset and changelog management.
- Static assets (images, demos) live in `static/`.
- Source code for IX components is **not** in this repo; this is documentation only.
- Cross-references between docs use relative Markdown links.

## Developer Workflows

- **Build docs:** `pnpm build` (uses Docusaurus)
- **Local dev:** `pnpm start` (serves docs locally)
- **Scripts:** Use scripts in `scripts/` for tasks like copying themes, downloading Figma images, preparing markdown, and fetching changelogs.
- **Blog posts:** Add to `blog/YYYY-MM-DD-title/` with images and `index.md`.

## Conventions & Patterns

- All docs and blog posts use Markdown, with frontmatter for metadata.
- Component docs follow a folder-per-component pattern under `docs/components/`.
- Custom fields, changelogs, and Figma asset integration are handled by scripts and plugins.

## Integration Points

- Figma assets: Managed via `plugins/figma-pictures/` and related scripts.
- Netlify: Handles deployment, preview, and hosting.

## Key Files & Directories

- `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`: Docusaurus site config.
- `docs/`, `blog/`: Main content.
- `plugins/`: Docusaurus plugins (e.g., Figma integration).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for asset and markdown management.
- `static/`: Images, demos, and other static assets.
- `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Dependency management.

## Example Patterns

- To add a new component doc: create `docs/components/<component>/overview.md`.
- To add a blog post: create `blog/YYYY-MM-DD-title/index.md` and add images to the same folder.
- To integrate Figma assets: use scripts in `plugins/figma-pictures/` and reference images in Markdown.
