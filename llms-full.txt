# Siemens Industrial Experience

> Siemens Industrial Experience

This file contains all documentation content in a single document following the llmstxt.org standard.

## About and legal - Usage


The About and legal component appears when users click on the "About and legal" item (1) and overlays the current content. Closing this overlay brings users back to the original content.

![About and legal overlay](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7072-40744&t=PwyZur5dxqEH6cfd-4)

1. Application menu item - info
2. Content header
3. Close button
4. Tabs
5. Changeable content

## Options

- **Tabs:** Use tabs with meaningful labels to separate content into categories.
- **Label:** Title that is shown in the content header. We recommend using the default "About & legal information" wording.
- **Content:** Add information about the application, e.g. version, author, copyright. It can also include legal information, e.g. terms of service, privacy policy.

## Behavior

Overlay opens on top of application content with a semi-transparent background with a background blur effect to emphasize the overlay character. Closing this overlay brings users back to the previous content.

The overlay can be closed in three ways:

- Select the close button.
- Click the info icon again.
- Click another navigation item.

When the navigation menu is collapsed, the overlay stays open.

:::info
The About and Legal components require specific content to comply with Siemens AG regulations. The official content and guidelines are exclusively available for Siemens AG employees and can be accessed [here](https://code.siemens.com/siemens-ix/ix-brand-theme/-/blob/af74de1ec3c7d9b1fdd6e06e9c0c6eadefaf695b/apps/documentation/src/pages/about-legal-information.md).

## Application - Usage


Application is a technical and infrastructural component without a direct visual appearance. It lays out the top-level app elements like the [header](/docs/components/application-header/guide.md). The application component acts as a centralized hub for configuring aspects of your web application, such as screen breakpoints, theming and app switch configuration. By consolidating these configuration points, it simplifies the management of application-wide settings and ensures a consistent user interface across different scenarios.

The component itself is designed with modularity in mind. It can be seamlessly integrated with other components such as [application header](/docs/components/application-header/guide.md), [application menu](/docs/components/application-menu/guide.md), [content](/docs/components/content/guide.md) and more. This modular approach allows you to mix and match components based on your specific application requirements, providing flexibility and customization options.

It's important to note that the application component focuses solely on layouting and does not dictate visual design.

## Application example

![Application example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=6694-51419&t=bGky2tHjBPC9fOGT-4)

1. [Application header](/docs/components/application-header/guide)
2. [Application menu](/docs/components/application-menu/guide)
3. [Content](/docs/components/content/guide)

## Application switch

![Application switch and modal](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1665-19417&mode=design&t=I0iEEuzKJJPK4Sum-11)

1. Application switch button opens the modal
2. Application switch modal with a list of applications
3. Current application
4. Link to another application with icon, name and optional description
5. Indicator "open in a new browser tab"
6. Close icon

With the application switch, users can navigate across applications. The interaction control – the application switch button (1) – is in the [application header](../application-header). Clicking the button opens a modal (2) with a list of available applications your users can switch to. This list is technically defined in the application component and its content depends on your product strategy. Our lists typically contain applications belonging to a software suite, applications with a similar scope or applications a user has purchased.

Clicking the current application closes the modal. Clicking another application closes the modal and opens the target application in the same or in a new browser tab, depending on the defined target option. Switching between browser tabs is much faster than loading the applications each time in the same browser tab, however, switching between multiple browser tabs could confuse users.

We typically avoid opening the same application in multiple browser tabs. Instead, we recommend switching to the browser tab where the application is already open. Nonetheless, be aware this does not work under all circumstances and some browsers cannot support this feature.

## Options

- **forceBreakpoint:** Forces a specific breakpoint "lg", "md" or "sm". This can be used to force a specific application behavior that ignores the current browser viewport width.

## Behavior

The application component automatically adapts, by default, to three breakpoints and changes the application layout accordingly:

- "lg" for large screens (min-width 62em)
- "md" for medium screens (min-width 48em)
- "sm" for small screens (min-width 36em)

---

## Application header - Usage


In its simplest version, application headers only show the company logo and the application name.

![Application header simple](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39093&mode=design)

1. Company logo
2. Application name

The **company logo** (1) identifies the brand. For Siemens applications, the Siemens logo with the brand theme is the default combination. Contractual agreements may allow partner logos under certain conditions.
The logo adapts its width automatically, height remains fixed. It is colored at runtime based on the selected theme if the following prerequisites are met:
- Logo is provided as SVG
- Color of SVG elements are set to `currentcolor`

Without meeting these prerequisites, the logo appears without any color adaption.

The **application name** (2) shows the official name of the application. Its width adjusts dynamically but may be truncated if space is limited by other header elements.

## Options

The app header component offers great flexibility through optional elements, but each addition should be considered carefully. Adding too many elements can reduce usability and introduce challenges, especially regarding responsiveness and overflow behavior. We recommend keeping the header clean and lean.

### Avatar

![Avatar and avatar dropdown](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39231&mode=design)

1. User avatar
2. Avatar dropdown

The avatar indicates the currently logged in user and provides access to user-related actions. Its position in the application header ensures visibility of security-relevant information across all breakpoints.

Clicking the avatar opens a dropdown with additional user information and actions such as log out or user profile. If the application does not support multiple users or user profiles, do not use the avatar.

For applications that allow usage without login, consider alternative approaches:
- Show a login button in the [slot for additional elements](#slot-for-right-aligned-content) and hide the avatar
- Display the avatar with a placeholder image and provide login-related information and actions in the dropdown

### Application switch

![Application switch](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39460&mode=design)

Use the application switch (see [application](../application)) to launch and navigate between related applications. Clicking the application switch (1) opens a modal (2) with a list of available applications.

### Application icon

![Application icon](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39393&mode=design)

The application icon (1) is a non-interactive visual element placed in the header to represent the application. It is displayed within a fixed size and uses a defined border radius. The standard web image formats are supported. The provided image is scaled if necessary while maintaining the aspect ratio.

An optional outline (2) can be added to visually separate the icon from the background when needed. It should only be used when contrast or clarity requires it.

### Suffix for application name

![Application name suffix](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39713&mode=design)

The application name suffix (1) appears to the right of the application name. It provides additional information or context. For Siemens applications, we use it for contractually regulated additions in partner branding scenarios, e.g. "powered by Siemens".

### Slot for right-aligned content

![Slot](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39744&mode=design)

The slot (1) provides space for placing functions and information aligned to the right side of the application header. We use this slot for high-level information or actions impacting the application context, e.g. mode switching.

We typically use the slot for:
- Log in button, if the application runs without a logged-in user
- Changing the top-level data context like environment, workspace, or tenant
- Displaying important contextual information, e.g. local times in remote access scenarios
- Access to application-wide actions like global search

Overflow behavior is not handled automatically. At breakpoint sm, the slot collapses and its content becomes accessible via an overflow icon. See [behavior](#behavior) for details.

### Secondary slot for left-aligned content

![Secondary slot](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A39911&mode=design)

The secondary slot (1) allows the placement of functions aligned to the left side of the application header.
We typically use the secondary slot for:
- Lean elements such as toolbars, which offer compact access to key actions and can be easily adapted for overflow behavior.
- While primary navigation tabs can also be placed here, they consume more space and are less flexible in responsive layouts.

Overflow behavior is not handled automatically. At breakpoint sm, the slot collapses and its content becomes accessible via an overflow icon. See [behavior](#behavior) for details.

### Borderless

![Borderless](https://www.figma.com/file/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o?type=design&node-id=6427%3A40378&mode=design)

The borderless option sets the existing bottom border (1) of the header to a transparent color. Using the same background color, this creates a visual connection between the header and the following element, making them appear as a unified block.

### Window controls

![OS specific window controls](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=6599-45912&t=07oqeGxwT0wAyLin-11)

If the applications runs in a desktop framework like Electron, we recommend the following approach to avoid an additional OS-specific window header above the application header:
- Place a container (2) beside the actual application header (1), while considering the OS specifics.
- Place the window controls inside and consider applying the OS specific style and behavior.
- Use same height, background and border properties for this container.

### Framework header

If the application is hosted inside a framework that comes with its own header, you can omit the entire application header to avoid having two headers on top of each other. The framework’s header then provides the brand identity, the application name and other information.

## Behavior

The header automatically adapts the breakpoints defined in the [application](../application) layout.

![Application header at breakpoints lg/md and sm](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=6427-40565&t=S6lUQ3W9x7i87i8E-4)

At breakpoints "lg" and "md" the application header remains unchanged, truncation applies to the application name (1). When its minimum width is, reached truncation is applied to the secondary slot.

At breakpoint "sm" the layout changes in the following way:
- The application menu is hidden and replaced by a menu icon (2) in the header, clicking it opens the menu.
- The company logo and a possibly used application name suffix is not shown.
- If the application switch (3) is used, it moves to the application menu.
- If slots are used, their elements move into dedicated sections in the overflow dropdown (4), accessible via the overflow icon (5).
- If the manual overflow slot is used, its content appears at lowest position within the overflow dropdown (7).

### Manual overflow menu
- The overflow slot can be manually filled to trigger the overflow menu at any breakpoint.
- When content is placed in the manual overflow slot, the overflow button appears even at medium (md) and large (lg) viewports.
- This allows intentional placement of elements into the overflow menu (6), independent of automatic breakpoint behavior.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do align other slot usages for Siemens applications with our team to keep a consistent look and feel
- Do use the avatar dropdown for actions related to the current logged in user
- Do test layout behavior at all breakpoints to ensure content remains accessible
- Don’t overload the slots with too many elements to avoid losing clarity and hierarchy
- Don’t use the avatar if your application does not support user profiles
- Don’t rely on automatic overflow handling for complex layouts, instead reduce complexity

## Application menu - Usage


The navigation menu is an essential part of your application. It offers a way to directly navigate to the main application parts and it can give your users access to legal and version information, and access to settings.

![Navigation menu collapsed and expanded](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=990-122297&t=ePzRHLjXBksLOgto-4)

1. Expand/collapse icon button
2. Main navigation section
3. Bottom section
4. Selected item
5. Item with notification
6. Second level navigation menu
7. [Settings](../settings)
8. Toggle theme
9. Custom item
10. [About & legal](../about-and-legal)

## Options

- **Navigation menu:**
	- **Enable settings:** Show the settings item in the bottom section which opens the [settings](../settings) overlay.
	- **Enable toggle theme:** Use the option to offer your users an easy and direct way to toggle between light and dark themes. We typically don’t use it when dedicated theme settings are available elsewhere e.g. in the [settings](../settings) overlay.
- **Menu items and menu category:**
	- **Notifications:** Display a number at the top right corner of the icon.
	- **Icon:** Define an icon for an item. We recommend to using icons in submenu items rarely since they often don’t add any value.
	- **Label:** Define the name of the menu item or menu category which is visible when the navigation menu is expanded.
	- **Selected:** Mark a menu item as selected which highlights it in the navigation menu.
	- **Tooltip text:** By default, the tooltip will show the label of the menu item or menu category. Override it with custom text to give additional context if the label alone is not sufficient.
## Behavior in context

![Navigation menu overflow behavior](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1013-68267&mode=design&t=RG8M7S3eIKxiDqv5-11)

- Navigation menu expands and collapses with a transition.
- The width of the collapse and expand state are fixed and cannot be configured.
- The number of menu items can overflow with a vertical scroll, this is recognizable by the shadow at the bottom and/or top.
- On hover, a tooltip is shown that displays the label of the menu item or menu category by default.
- Items in the bottom section do not navigate away from the current content. They either toggle states, e.g. light and dark mode, or open a layer over the current content. This means users do not lose their current workflow by interacting with these items.

## States
The application menu has two states: collapsed and expanded. The appearance of the states varies between screen sizes.
## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use icons in second-level navigation items when it helps users to better understand and recognize them
- Do use a custom tooltip text if the label is so long that it gets truncated or needs additional context
- Don’t mix menu items with and without icons within a second-level navigation category
- Don’t place non-navigational items in the navigation section
- Don’t place navigation items in the bottom section as items in the bottom section must not navigate away from the current context

## Avatar - Usage


Avatars are visual or textual representations of individual identities, most often used to represent users logged into a system. Identity providers or user management systems usually provide identity information, and the amount of information provided varies from system to system. The avatar component offers different options to handle this.

## Options

![Avatar overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=963-565&mode=design&t=M9CowfOcGyqnSycV-4)

| Option       | Description and usage |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default (1)  | Without any option set, the visual is just a predefined placeholder graphic. It can be used when identity information is unavailable or cannot be used for other reasons. |
| Initials (2) | Shows a string of one or two characters. Can be used when only textual information is available. Examples: A user’s initials (JD for John Doe) or the first character from the username (J for johndoe) |
| Image (3)    | Shows an image. Can be used when identity information includes an image |

## Behavior

The avatar is a display-only component with no further interactions. Images provided are proportionally scaled to fill the content. A circle shape clips the image. All image formats that browser engines support can be used.

## Dos and Don’ts

![Avatar dos and don‘ts](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=975-13&mode=design&t=SxUA6AcHswBAiIzi-4)

- Don’t use more than 2 characters when using the "Initials" option

---

## Blind - Usage


Blinds are UI controls that allow the users to hide or reveal content by clicking on a control element. Blinds can display a large amount of content in a compact space or present information in an organized and hierarchical way. Blinds reduce the user's cognitive load by removing clutter and less important information from an interface. We typically don’t use blinds if the content is central to the user's task due to its reduced visibility and accessibility.

Blinds consist of a header section on the top and a content section below. The header section contains a chevron on the left followed by the blind's label. Within the content section, content can be placed freely.

![Blind overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2-2&mode=design&t=9faEnH99BaAxqCGM-1)

1. Header section
2. Content section

## Types

Multiple blinds can be placed below each other to create an accordion. The recommended distance between the blinds is `0.5rem`. Typically, only one blind can be opened within an accordion but users can be allowed to open multiple blinds at a time.

![Accordion](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2-655&mode=design&t=9faEnH99BaAxqCGM-1)

## Variants

Multiple blind variants are available:

- **Filled**: Default variant
- **Outline**: Variant for lower visual emphasis
- **Primary**: Variant for high visual emphasis
- **State-related variants**: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info, neutral

![Blind variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=929-47485&mode=design&t=9faEnH99BaAxqCGM-1)

## Options

- **Icon**: Blinds can, but don’t have to, include an icon in the header section. The icon is positioned before the blind label.
- **Sublabel**: A secondary label can be placed within the header section. The sublabel gives additional information about the blind's content.
- **Header action**: The header section can contain an action area. We typically use the action area to include one or two buttons for actions directly related to the blind, e.g. to delete the blind or to navigate to additional content.

## Behavior in context

The user expands and collapses the blind by pressing anywhere in the header section. When the blind is expanded, content below the blind is moved downwards.

## States

For all blind variants, a default, hover, active and focused state is available.

![Blind states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2-352&mode=design&t=9faEnH99BaAxqCGM-1)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do stay within the recommended number of blinds - between 3 and 7
- Don’t use multi-line text in the header. The header section has a fixed height for single-line text entries
- Don’t change the position of the chevron icon and the blind's label in the header
- Don’t use a blind if there is only a single category to be displayed
- Don’t use blinds to display hierarchically structured files or objects - rather use a tree for such cases

## Breadcrumb - Usage


Breadcrumb navigation is a UI control that allows users to track their location within an application and easily navigate to previous or child pages.
Breadcrumbs make the structure of applications transparent to users. We typically use breadcrumbs in applications that have a deep hierarchy of pages or content. This helps users understand where they are within applications, and makes it easier to navigate to pages further along the navigation tree. As a general rule, we use breadcrumbs for information architecture with more than two levels, but not as a replacement for an application's main navigation. If the information structure is extremely complex, we often consider using a tree instead of a breadcrumb.

Breadcrumb items are interactive. Users navigate to their respective location by pressing the item. Each item contains a breadcrumb label. All items in the breadcrumb path are always followed by a chevron icon except for the last item.

![Breadcrumb overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=20-8463&mode=design&t=JS1Aklcq48swr0Im-1)

1. Breadcrumb item
2. Separator
3. Dropdown

## Options

![Breadcrumb variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=20-352&mode=design&t=JS1Aklcq48swr0Im-1)

- **Subtle**: By default, breadcrumbs appear in a subtle appearance. Switch to a solid appearance for higher visual emphasis.
- **Icon**: Breadcrumb items can, but don’t have to, include an icon. The icon is positioned before the breadcrumb label. Icons can be included for each item or only for specific items (e.g. the root item).
- **Show child items on last item**: By default, the last item of the breadcrumb doesn't offer any user interaction. An interactive item variant is available which allows the user to browse to child pages of the current page. Pressing the item triggers a dropdown listing all child elements.
- **Visible item count**: By default, breadcrumbs display a limited number of items. This number can be adjusted.

## Behavior in context

- **Population**: As a general rule, we populate breadcrumbs location-based to reflect the hierarchy of the application and the location of the user within it. We always include the current location in the breadcrumb.
- **Overflow**: If the number of items exceeds the defined limit, items are hidden within a dropdown menu at the beginning of the path. The dropdown menu is triggered by pressing the respective item. The truncation is visualized with an ellipsis. The overflow behavior can also be triggered if the available space does not allow the complete display of the breadcrumb in one line.
- **Text truncation**: Truncation is applied to individual breadcrumb items if the maximum width of the breadcrumb item is exceeded. The label name is truncated with an ellipsis.
- **Placement**: We typically place breadcrumbs at the top left side of the page/content area, below the header and above the page title.

## States

Interactive items can take one of four states: Default, hover, active and focused. Non-interactive items are always in default state.

![States of breadcrumb items](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=120-7463&mode=design&t=JS1Aklcq48swr0Im-1)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do label each item, i.e. use more than icons
- Do use single-line text entries as breadcrumb items have a fixed height
- Don’t use breadcrumbs to display a multistep process (use the [workflow](../workflow) control instead)
- Don’t show multiple breadcrumbs on one screen, e.g. in a content area and in a drawer

## Button - Usage


Buttons initiate actions, apply actions to selected objects and activate/deactivate functions. We typically use buttons to trigger an immediate action, and you can place them within dialogs, forms, modal windows and other containers.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5771-4670&t=rJDt18BP7skzAPnM-4)

1. Label
2. Icon
3. Icon right

## Variants

![Button variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5771-6179&t=yk9Vv3HSXaEzBbQk-4)

- **Primary:** Use for primary actions, e.g. "Confirm" or "Send".
- **Secondary:** Use for secondary actions supporting the primary action, e.g. "Cancel" or "Reset".
- **Tertiary:** Use for tertiary actions that serve specialized or conditional purposes, e.g. "Advanced settings", "More options", "Help" or "Customize", "Change preferences" or "View details".

- **Subtle variants:** Use as an alternative when a softer visual preference is required. When using the **subtle primary** button for the primary action, ensure that **subtle secondary** and **subtle tertiary** buttons are used for supporting and contextual actions respectively.

- **Danger variants:** Use for destructive or critical actions like "delete" or "remove". We typically use the danger button for actions that are irreversible or have a significant impact on the user’s data or the application state.

## Options

- **Label:** Displays short, descriptive text that clearly communicates the action triggered by the button.
- **Icon:** Appears left of the label and supports the label visually. This is the preferred position. Use icons that are widely recognized by users for the intended action. See [icon button](../icon-button/index.mdx) for buttons without label with icon only. In loading state, this icon is replaced by a loading spinner.
- **Icon right:** Appears to the right of the label. Use this position as placing the icon on the left is counterintuitive, such as a “Next” button with a right-pointing arrow in wizard-like modals.
- **Type:** Use `submit` when sending user input from a form to a server. For all other actions such as triggering dialogs or performing navigation use the default type `button`.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** Buttons can be triggered by pressing anywhere within the button container. When buttons are focused, they can be triggered by pressing `Space`.
- **Text truncation:** Button labels are not truncated. All text on buttons is one line only.
- **Alignment:** Buttons can be left or right-aligned or fully span a container’s width.
- **Button width:** Buttons dynamically adjust their width based on content, but have a default minimum width of `5rem` to ensure harmonious alignment for common pairs like "OK" and "Cancel". The minimum width can be customized for different needs.
- **Cluster buttons:** Cluster buttons in groups with related functions. A cluster might include various types of buttons, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary. We recommend a gap of `0.5rem` between buttons.

![Cluster buttons](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5773-6487&t=yk9Vv3HSXaEzBbQk-4)

## States

Buttons have six states: Default, hover, active, disabled, loading and focused. In a disabled and loading state, buttons are visually displayed but never offer any user interaction.

![Button states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5878-6015&t=yk9Vv3HSXaEzBbQk-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use short button labels to allow users to quickly scan, understand and remember them (see our [writing style guide](../../guidelines/language/dialogs-and-buttons.md))
- Do use ellipsis (…) to indicate that an action requires further input or choice from the user, e.g. "Save as…" which opens a list of file types to choose from
- Do use the primary variant for buttons to indicate one primary action in a visual unit, all other secondary actions should use the secondary variant
- Don’t place icons both left and right of the label on the same button
- Don’t use the danger button excessively or repetitively in lists or tables
- Don’t rely on standard buttons when many actions are necessary (use [dropdown buttons](../dropdown-button/index.mdx) or [split buttons](../split-button/index.mdx) instead, or move some functionality to a [pane](../panes/index.mdx) or a [dialog](../modal/index.mdx))

## Card - Usage


Cards make it easy for users to quickly scan small chunks of information. We typically use cards to create dashboards or modular, flexible designs that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Additionally, cards can be used to draw attention to important content and serve as an entry point to deeper levels of navigation or detailed views.

We offer three types of cards:
1. **Cards:** Use flexibly to display various types of content, e.g. images, charts or key data.
2. **Action cards:** Use to trigger key actions, similar to [buttons](../button).
3. **Push cards:** Use to display notifications and additional content related to the notification value.

## Variants

Cards are available in nine variants:

* Outline: Use as default for a balanced and subtle appearance.
* Filled
* Alarm
* Critical
* Warning
* Success
* Info
* Neutral
* Primary

Each variant emphasizes different aspects to guide the user's attention. These variants differ visually through the presence of an outline and a distinct container fill color, but they all follow the same interaction pattern.

![Card variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=858-4969&mode=design&t=RDimbEsIHFIXIByo-1)

## Options

- **Card:**
	- **Selected:** Use the selected state to indicate that the corresponding action is currently active.
	- **Content area:** Cards can contain various types of content, e.g. images, charts, key data. It is positioned below the heading and subheading. We recommend a padding of `1rem`.
- **Action card & push card**:
	- **Selected (action card only):** Use the selected state in action cards to indicate that the corresponding action is currently active.
	- **Icon:** Use icons that are widely recognized by users for the intended action.
	- **Notification (push card only):** By default, push cards display a notification value at the top of the container. This value is logically related to the items displayed in the expanding content area.
	- **Heading:** Display a heading in the top-left corner of the container.
	- **Subheading:** Display a subheading below the heading to provide additional context.
	- **Expandable content (push card only):** Push cards can include an expandable content area that reveals additional information when expanded. This area is positioned below the subheading and is hidden by default.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** As a general rule, the entire card container is interactive and clickable. If the card also contains interactive elements, the corresponding actions are triggered.
- **Size:**
	- By default, cards have a fixed width and height. However, content overflow is not managed automatically, so the card size must be manually adjusted.
	- Action cards have a default width and height which can be adjusted to fit nicely in layouts.
	- Push cards have a fixed height and a default width. The width can be adjusted as needed.
- **Placement:** We typically group cards using [grids](../layout-grid) or [card lists](../card-list) and position them in the top-left of their container.

![Card examples](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1329-26613&mode=design&t=sOZRNgWt7R52iLSF-1)
## States

Cards have four states: Default, hover, active and focused.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do group cards in [card lists](../card-list) or [grids](../grid)
- Do keep multiple cards equal in size
- Don’t nest cards inside each other
- Don’t use cards to collect user input

## Card list - Usage


Card list content can be hidden or revealed by clicking on a control element. We typically use card lists on dashboards to show a huge amount of information in an organized and hierarchical way.

Card lists consist of a header section at the top and a content section below. The header section includes an icon button with a chevron on the left, followed by the card list's label. In the content section, items of the same type can be arranged in two different layout styles: stack and scroll.

![Card list overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=897-31906&mode=design&t=2pf1CqY5ifYKN3F2-1)

1. Header section
2. Content section
3. "Show all" button
4. "Show more" card

## Types

The stack card list style displays content items from left to right next to each other and wraps them into a new line when space runs out. This means the height of the section can dynamically change.

![Card list - stack style](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=910-8581&mode=design&t=2pf1CqY5ifYKN3F2-1)

The scroll card list style displays the content items from left to right next to each other in a single row. When the space runs out, horizontal scrolling is enabled, indicated by a semi-transparent area on the left or right end of the content section.

![Card list - scroll style](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=915-8647&mode=design&t=2pf1CqY5ifYKN3F2-1)

## Options

- **Label**: Card lists can include a label in the header section. The label is positioned right next to the chevron.
- **Collapse**: By default, the card list is expanded, but this can be customized to suit your specific needs.
- **Max visible cards**: By default, the card list displays a maximum of 12 items. If more items are available, a "Show more" card is displayed.
- **Show all button**: The header section can contain a button that triggers the action to show all card list items. Typically, these items are shown on a new page.
- **String - Show all**: By default, the button to display all items is labeled "Show all".
- **Show all count**: This represents the total number of card list items. This value is displayed on the "Show all" button.
- **String - More cards**: By default, the card used to indicate when there are more items available is labeled "There are more cards available".

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction**: Users expand and collapse card list content by clicking on the icon button with the chevron in the header section. When the card list is expanded, content below the card list is pushed downwards.
- **"Show all" button**: Sometimes card lists only need to show the most important or most recent items. Clicking on the "Show all" button in the header section shows all items. Typically, these items are displayed on a new page.
- **"Show more" card**: The number of visible items inside a list can be limited to reduce the user's cognitive load. The "Show more" card indicates that more information is available. Selecting the card either displays the next chunk of items or shows all items on a new page, similar to the "Show all" button pattern.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do keep cards and items within card lists the same size
- Don’t place different types of components within card lists
- Don’t nest card lists within each other

## Category filter - Usage


The category filter component enhances data navigation and user experience. We typically use a category filter to efficiently navigate large data sets, and it’s particularly useful for complex data scenarios. The filter also enhances the user experience by providing autocomplete suggestions and customizable filter conditions.

![Category filter overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1799-38402&mode=design&t=hgAA8GogE70JbHHy-1)

1. Container
2. Search icon
3. Input chip
4. Clear button

## Options

- **Categories**: Select these predefined groups to narrow down searches or browsing. The categories are customizable and should be defined based on the specific needs of your application or website.
- **Suggestions**: These are potential search terms that appear as users begin to type in the input field. The aim is to assist users by predicting their intended search or category, thereby speeding up the input process and reducing potential errors.
- **Non-selectable categories**: This option is useful in scenarios where the user should not be able to select certain categories. This could be due to categories that are irrelevant in the current context, restricted through user permissions or dependent on other conditions.
- **Repeat categories**: Allows users to select the same category more than once. This can be useful when users want to apply different filter conditions to the same category.
- **Placeholder**: Use to provide guidance or context to users when the category filter is empty.
- **Icon**: The default icon is "search". Changing or hiding the icon within the category filter enhances the user experience and improves visual communication.
- **Plain text**: Provides the possibility to do a plain text search without choosing a specific category.
- **Static operator**: Use to restrict the filter condition to either equal (=) or not equal (!=). This is useful when it doesn't make sense, or is not applicable, to let the user decide between equal and not equal. By default, the filter condition is without restriction.

## Behavior

- **Default**: The category filter is designed to adapt to the user’s needs and the context it’s used in. As soon as the user starts typing, the filter begins to apply, narrowing down the available options based on user input. This provides a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Filter conditions**: These are the operators that determine how the filter matches the user’s input against the available categories. Available are equals (=) and not equals (!=). These conditions provide flexibility and precision in filtering, allowing users to find exactly what they’re looking for.
- **Display modes**: The different modes are automatically detected by the component itself. If the user enters more than one row of search terms it automatically increases the size. When it comes to more then two lines of search terms it applies a scrollbar automatically.
- **Autocomplete**: When the user starts typing it can automatically suggest possible matches. This helps with speeding up the input process and reducing potential errors.
- **Category selection**: The behavior of category selection can vary. It can be configured as non-selectable, multi-selectable or single-selectable depending on the specific application needs and context.
- **Without category selection**: Use without category selection if user input alone is sufficient to filter the data, such as when the data is not well-organized into distinct categories, or if the categories are too numerous/complex.
- **Visual feedback**: When a category is selected, it’s highlighted and a chip is added to the input field. If a user chooses to delete a category, the chip is removed and the data is unfiltered, allowing for further filtering.

## States

Category filter has six states: Default, hover, active, disabled, read-only and focused.

![Category filter states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1799-38415&mode=design&t=1vxCdaFjmBNHp8Sk-4)

- **Read-only**: By setting the category filter to read-only, accidental data modifications or deletions can be prevented. This can be particularly useful when dealing with critical or sensitive information that should not be altered without proper authorization.
- **Disabled**: This state is typically applied when the element is not applicable to the current context or when certain conditions must be met before the category filter can be enabled.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use if you have a large amount of content or products organized into different categories
- Do use when catering to a diverse user base with different interests or needs
- Do use if your content or products are organized into distinct categories or topics
- Do use to make it easier for users to refine their search queries and receive more targeted results
- Don’t use if your content is minimal or not organized into distinct categories
- Don’t use if it’s not the primary method of navigation
- Don’t use if it slows down the user experience
- Don’t use if your users are not familiar with the category names

## Checkbox - Usage


Checkboxes are commonly used when there are multiple options that can be selected or used to easily enable or disable a setting. They are often utilized in forms where users can choose multiple options, such as selecting items or categories that apply to a specific product or service.

![Checkbox anatomy](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3364-8247&t=VCAAFzKIYCDb7nIX-4)

1. Checkbox
2. Checkbox label
3. Group label
4. Group required indicator
5. Group helper or feedback text

## Options

- **Checkbox label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Indeterminate checkbox:** Indicates that only some items in a checkbox group are selected. We offer the indeterminate state, but the implementation when this state is active is the responsibility of each individual.
- **Checkbox group**: Group checkboxes to indicate that they are related. We typically use checkbox groups when multiple options need to be presented for selection, allowing users to choose any combination of the available choices. They are particularly useful in user interface design for forms, settings and preferences where multiple selections are possible.
- **Group label:** Add a label to the group of checkboxes to provide context to your users. We typically use short and descriptive labels to summarize the options in the group.
- **Group helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Group feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).

## Behavior in context

- **Validation**: See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Interaction**: Clicking on the checkbox toggles the state between checked and unchecked.
- **Grouping**: Checkbox groups have only one label and helper text for the entire group. Grouped checkboxes are validated collectively, not individually.

## States

![Checkbox states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3749-1431&t=VCAAFzKIYCDb7nIX-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use checkboxes when you have multiple options that can be selected
- Do group related checkboxes together to indicate their relationship
- Do use checkboxes in forms to allow users to select multiple options
- Don’t use a checkbox for binary choices (yes/no, true/false) - use a toggle switch instead
- Don’t use checkboxes for mutually exclusive options - use [radio buttons](../radio) instead
- Don’t use checkboxes for actions that have immediate consequences - use [buttons](../button) or links instead

---

## Chip - Usage


Chips typically contain a concise label and sometimes an icon, and they are both clickable and closable.

![Chip overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1149-41643&mode=design&t=ruQOzpPQJMKwnk8f-1)

1. Container
2. Label text
3. Icon
4. Close button

## Variants

With our chip variants, you can apply different colors based on their purpose, importance or context. We use chip variants to show class, status and levels of importance. The custom variant is often used for chips that visualize a high number of different categories, but does not permit color specification for hover and active states.

Chip variants:

- **Primary**: For high visual emphasis
- **State-related variants**: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info and neutral
- **Custom**: For a customized background and label color

![Chip variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1201-9512&mode=design&t=ruQOzpPQJMKwnk8f-1)

## Options

- **Active**: Specifies chip interactivity. When set to false, user input such as mouse-over and keyboard navigation are disabled and the close button is not visible.
- **Background**: Use to set a custom background color when you require more flexibility in styling the chip. Only available for the custom chip variant.
- **Outline**: Use for lower visual emphasis.
- **Closable**: When set, the chip contains a close button that removes the entire chip when selected. This feature is only applicable to active chips so users can easily remove specific chips when necessary.
- **Icon**: Chips can include an icon within the element which is positioned before the chip's label.
- **Color**: Customize font and icon color for chip. This allows users to specify a unique font color in combination with a custom background color (only applicable when the variant is set to 'custom').
- **Width**: Typically content length determines chip width with a minimum width of '2rem'. Chip width can be set to a specific value.
- **Tooltip text**: Provide a specific text to be displayed as the tooltip or set the attribute without a specific value to display the chip's text content.

## Behavior

- **Reactive**: Chips react or change their appearance or behavior based on user actions. For example, updates occur as a response to system actions, providing real-time information about system changes or events.
- **Multi-selection**: Chips can visualize multi-selection and filter actions. This helps users to easily identify and understand their choices.
- **Placement**: We typically place chips inline with other objects to inform users about their state, within tables or grouped together to show selected options and filters. We do not place chips within input and filter components as these components have similar components already built-in.
- **Dismiss**: When users select close, chips are dismissed from the list or interface and are removed visually.
- **Text truncation**: When a width is set for chips, long labels are truncated to fit the available space.

## States

Chips take a default, hover, focused or active state with a varying background color. For the custom chip variant, the specified colors for font and background are applied to all states.

![Chip states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1246-6190&mode=design&t=GHOok90R6TcaUrYi-1)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use chips to tag and categorize so users can easily organize and filter content
- Do ensure proper color contrast between chip background and text/icon with the custom variant to support readability
- Do consider chip spacing for easy tapping or selecting with mobiles and desktops
- Don’t overuse chips as this leads to cluttered and overwhelming interfaces
- Don’t use different styles for chips with the same or similar use
- Don’t use chips without any interaction (we recommend pills instead)

## Content - Usage


![application content](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1759-25130&mode=design&t=UPXhDWuRHtygtfFI-11)

The purple dotted line illustrates the extent of the content component.

1. Header slot (optional): Hosts a header component like the [content header](../content-header).
2. Current content

---

## Content header - Usage


The content header helps users understand what the page is about. We typically use it at the very top of the page to show a clear page hierarchy.

![Content header overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2250-4784&mode=design&t=XmCepM9jPR9PImPw-4)

1. Back button
2. Header title
3. Header subtitle
4. Header slot
5. Action buttons

## Variants

Our content header variants makes it easier to achieve a well-balanced visual hierarchy throughout the page.

- Primary: In our applications, we most often use the primary variant for main pages or primary sections.
- Secondary: We typically use this variant when we want to provide context or actions for a specific section of a page, such as when displaying detailed information related to a selected item from a list.

![Content header variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2250-9102&mode=design&t=XmCepM9jPR9PImPw-4)

## Options

- **Back button**: Enable if you want to provide a way for the user to navigate back.
- **Header title**: Set your page title here. Use a clear, short and descriptive wording.
- **Header subtitle**: Provide additional info for your content such as a descriptive sentence when required.
- **Header slot**: Use this slot to add additional content that is relevant to the page. We typically use it to display an object's status or a counter displaying the number of children by using a [pill](../pill).
- **Action buttons**: Offer convenient shortcuts for actions that the user might need to perform frequently, for example "Add" or "Edit".

## Behavior

- **Interaction**: The back button navigates usually one step back or behaves the same as the browser back. Action buttons typically navigate to another view.
- **Alignment**:
	- Place the content header at the very top left corner related to the content position.
	- Back button, title and subtitle are automatically aligned on the left side while the action buttons are aligned on the right side.
	- Elements in the header slot are top aligned by default. Use top margin to center align it with the title.
- **Cluster action buttons**: Action buttons are automatically aligned to the right. An example for the primary content header has the back button, title and subtitle at the left top corner of the whole page, and the action buttons at the right top corner of the page.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use to provide quick access to common tasks for the whole content area
- Do place only items in the header slot that don’t take up too much space, such as a status or a counter
- Don’t use a secondary content header as a page title
- Don’t use more than one primary headline in one page

## Custom field - Usage


The custom field's properties allow you to control the validation state of the field and the helper text. It's a versatile tool to create your own form fields that can be used in combination with the 'Form' components to create complex forms.

![Custom field](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3303-3291&t=SikqVQr6LWjMEjKI-4)

1. Label
2. Helper or feedback text
3. Form component(s)
4. Required indicator

## Options

- **Label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Group label:** Add a label to the group of radio buttons to provide context to your users. We typically use short and descriptive labels to summarize the options in the group.
- **Helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Customization**: Add form components to create the use case you need. For example, for a file upload field, add an input field with a `readonly` state and an [icon button](../icon-button).

![Custom field example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3483-7223&t=DlxXBQ9vTnyDcIUI-4)

## Behavior in context

- **Validation:** See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Form behavior:** See [behavior](../forms-behavior).

## States

The states depend on the component that you use in the custom field. The custom field itself does not have any interaction states.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use the custom field when your desired solution is not covered by the already existing form field components
- Do use the custom field in combination with the form component to create complex forms
- Don’t use the custom field for simple form fields, use the form field component instead
- Don’t use the custom field without a form component, it is a wrapper component that is meant to be used in combination with the form component
- Don’t use helper and feedback texts for single fields within a custom field, use the helper and feedback text of the whole custom field instead

## Dropdown - Usage


Dropdown containers allow users to select one option from a list. Selecting one of the items in the dropdown performs the action.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2353-2278&mode=design&t=OVHeXvLZYLkP2CzN-4)

1. Dropdown container
2. Item
3. Header
4. Quick actions
5. Submenu
6. Checked
7. Separator
8. Icon
9. Label

## Options

- **Header:** Add a header for the dropdown container. This allows users to better understand which elements are in the dropdown.
- **Quick actions:** Add a quick action bar. Add 3 to 5 actions/items to the quick actions. We typically use quick actions to access common functions such as cut, copy and paste.
- **Checked:** Mark selected items in the dropdown with a check mark. We typically use check marks when an item can be activated (e.g. for the dropdown "Sort by:" selection: name, modified date, create date).
- **Submenu:** Add a submenu for a multi-level dropdown. We typically use a submenu when there is a long item list and different systematic categorization within the items.
- **Separator:** Add a separator to visually divide items from each other. We normally use a separator to isolate individual elements from a cohesive item list.
- **Icon:** Icons can be displayed to support the label and make the item more easy to discover by the user. The icon should be widely known for representing the action or function among your users.
- **Label:** Set a label for the dropdown item. We typically use short labels including verbs.
- **Trigger:** The trigger defines which element opens the dropdown. A trigger should also be defined for a dropdown submenu. We typically use a button as the trigger element.
- **Anchor:** An anchor defines where the dropdown is placed. When no anchor is defined the trigger element is used as the anchor.
- **Close behavior:** Defines whether a click inside and/or outside the dropdown closes the dropdown. A submenu is always closed together with the parent dropdown. Three Options are possible:
  - Inside: clicking within the dropdown closes the dropdown.
  - Outside: clicking outside the dropdown closes the dropdown.
  - Both: clicking within and outside the dropdown closes the dropdown.
  - False: dropdown will only close if it’s parent gets closed.
- **Placement:** Place a dropdown at the top, bottom, left or right edge as well as at the beginning or end of the trigger/anchor element. The placement may be automatically adjusted in case it cannot be displayed correctly (detailed behavior described in the context section below). We typically use the default (bottom right) placement option to ensure consistency.
- **Date selection:** Use the component [date dropdown](../date-dropdown) to get a date selection in the dropdown.

![Dropdown Examples](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2372-2696&mode=design&t=OVHeXvLZYLkP2CzN-4)

## Behavior in context

- **Text truncation:** The labels of the items and the header only consist of one line. A truncation only occurs if there is not enough space on the screen.
- **Scrollbar:** A dropdown is provided with a scrollbar when the dropdown takes up 50% of the screen.
- **Placement:** The position depends on the trigger/anchor element (e.g. a button). By default, the dropdown is displayed at the bottom right of the trigger element. When there is not enough space for the selected placement, it is corrected automatically. The placement of the submenu is always generated automatically.
- **Quick actions:** Quick actions only consist of icons, therefore, it is important to use icons that are understandable without a label or tooltip. A quick action bar can also be used without additional items in the dropdown.

![Dropdown in Context](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2463-3302&t=QaiBJKNOwHMdBuk2-4)

## States

Dropdown items have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. When a submenu is in an active state, the submenu displays an additional dropdown with selectable options.

![Item States](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2343-42235&mode=design&t=OVHeXvLZYLkP2CzN-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do structure dropdown items coherently with submenus, quick actions and separators
- Do use dropdowns to showcase related actions
- Do disable items that cannot be used at that moment
- Don’t use global navigation options in a dropdown
- Don’t use too many dropdown items - we recommend a maximum of seven
- Don’t insert the [date picker](../date-dropdown) instead)

## Dropdown button - Usage


Dropdown buttons are button elements that allow users to select an action from a list of options by clicking on a button and revealing a dropdown. Clicking on one of the exposed options triggers the action. We typically use dropdown buttons when no default action is available. Dropdown buttons typically group similar or related actions.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5887-7624&t=yk9Vv3HSXaEzBbQk-4)

1. Container
2. Label
3. Chevron
4. Icon

All the variants, options and states of the [button](../button/index.mdx) component apply to the dropdown button. We've listed additional or deviating specifications here.

## Options

- **Label:** Set a label for the dropdown button. We typically use short labels including verbs.
- **Placement:** Define where the dropdown appears when the button is active. Choose between different directions (top, bottom, left, right) and two options for alignment with the button (start, end). When there isn’t enough space for the chosen placement, it’s automatically corrected.

![Placement example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5887-7647&t=yk9Vv3HSXaEzBbQk-4)

1. Bottom-end placement
2. Bottom-start placement

- For options of the dropdown triggered when pressing the button, please refer to our separate [dropdown](../dropdown/index.mdx) component guide.
- The options **loading** and **type** are not available for dropdown buttons.

## States

Dropdown buttons have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. In an active state, dropdown buttons show a dropdown with the available options. The visual appearance of the states is the same as the [button](../button/index.mdx) component.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use dropdown buttons when selecting an option triggers an action
- Don’t use dropdown buttons when there is a frequent or most-important action (use a standard button or a split button instead)

## Forms field - Usage


![Field](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2781-323&t=pKzFQBhaXmjTsR8P-4)

1. Label
2. Form component
3. Helper text
4. Required indicator
5. Counter (input and textarea field only)

**Note:** In this chapter, we describe the default field component. For details about custom fields, see the [custom fields](../custom-field/) chapter.

## Options

- **Label:** Add a label for the field that provides context to your users.
- **Required:** The asterisk states whether user input is required on the field before submitting the form.
- **Field:** Use the appropriate field based on the type of input data, e.g. use [toggles](../toggle) for a binary choice.
- **Helper text:** Use to help users understand the field better. We typically use this when there are input restrictions or more information is required.
- **Show text as tooltip:** Display validation feedback either below the input field or as tooltip when the user hovers or focuses on the form field. Use a different text for the individual validation states that apply (see [validation](../forms-validation)).
- **Text alignment:** Set individual fields to align at the start or the end so inputs line up visually, e.g. a form with several [text input fields](../input) and a single [number input](../input-number).
- **Counter:** Use a counter to show the number of characters entered into the field and the maximum number of characters allowed. We typically use it for [textarea](../textarea) fields.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Behavior of a field as part of a form:** See [behavior](../forms-behavior).
- **Text truncation:** Labels, feedback and helper texts are not truncated but break into multiple lines if they exceed the field's width.

## States

Interaction states: Default, hover, active, disabled, readonly, focus.

When a feedback tooltip is chosen over a message, the field shows a tooltip when in focus or hovered over in specific validation states.

![States](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2781-12426&t=pKzFQBhaXmjTsR8P-4)

**Note:** There are also several validation states (default, valid, info, warning, invalid) that are described in [validation](../forms-validation).

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use a label for every field
- Do use a counter for fields with a character limit
- Do use helper text to provide additional information or context about the field
- Don’t use helper text as a replacement for clear labels
- Don’t mix different variants of feedback text and tooltips

## Forms layout - Usage


![Form layout examples](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3046-516&t=kneyH2DQ9aKpFhdv-4)

1. Small form (modal)
2. Medium form
3. Big form (page)

## Structuring a form

Effective ways to organize form elements enhance user comprehension and interaction within your forms:

- **Single-column layout:** Ideal for short forms with a few fields or small viewports.
- **Multi-column layout:** Suitable for long forms with multiple fields to save vertical space. Use a [layout grid](../layout-grid) or flexbox to align fields.
- **Tabbed layout:** Use [tabs](../tabs) to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Stepped layout:** Use our workflow pattern to guide users through multi-step forms.
- **Fieldset:** Group related fields together using fieldsets. This helps users understand the context of the information they are providing. Add a legend (title) to describe the field group.
- **Section heading:** Use section headings to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Blind:** Use a [blind](../blind) to hide optional fields and reveal them when the user selects a specific option.

## Best practice

- **Z and F shape pattern:** Follow natural reading patterns, for example left to right, to guide users through the form. Consider a clear order of fields to ensure users don’t forget to fill in fields and improve data quality.
- **Button alignment:** Position primary action buttons, e.g. submit and cancel consistently. We recommend: - Bottom left: Short forms (up to 5 fields) - Bottom right: Long forms (more than 5 fields) - Bottom right and sticky: Long forms that are already filled in (e.g. edit) with a large number of fields
- **Label alignment:** By default, the label is positioned above its input field. Use a custom field component for long forms with a lot of fields to position the label on the left (which saves vertical space).
- **Grouping fields:** In some cases, it makes sense to combine multiple fields in one [custom field](../custom-field) with a single label that are connected contextually or through validation, e.g. entering the value and unit of an entity, selecting start and end date. It allows a clearer validation, e.g. the end date must be after the start date.
- **Field width:** Use a consistent width for input fields to create a harmonious layout. For example, use a width of 100% for full-width fields and 50% for two-column fields.
- **Responsive behavior**: Use [layout grids](../layout-grid/) or flexbox to create responsive forms that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Forms validation - Usage


![Invalid state](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2767-5955&t=IIgjTqoOEP524yAH-4)

Key aspects:

- Data accuracy: Collect precise information for informed decisions.
- Security: Prevent malicious submissions.
- User experience: Improve by guiding users and saving time.

## Options

- Tooltip and feedback: See [form field](../forms-field).
- Validation options:
  - On value change (validate during input)
  - On blur (validate on leaving a field)
  - On blur of a certain part of the form (validate on leaving a certain part of the form)
  - On click on submit button (validate after users press the submit button)

## On value change

This option provides instant feedback to the user as they type, making it suitable for checking character rules.

Examples: As the user types a password, it instantly shows whether the password meets the required length or contains special characters. With an e-mail address, it validates when the email format is correct.

## On blur

With this option, validation occurs after the user finishes inputting and leaves the control. It provides immediate feedback and is commonly used for checking required inputs, specific data patterns and comparing input with server data.

Example: When the user enters an email address and moves to the next field, it validates when the email format is correct.

## On click on submit button

This option validates all relevant user input for completeness and plausibility after the user presses the submit button. It's useful for checking data before sending it to the server and for final validation on the server side.

Example: When the user fills out a registration form and clicks the submit button, it validates when all required fields are completed and if the data is valid.

## On blur of a certain part of the form

This option validates multiple input controls when users leave a specific part of the form. It provides feedback on the plausibility of multiple dependent inputs.

Example: When the user completes the shipping address section of an e-commerce checkout form and moves to the payment section, it validates if the shipping address is complete and valid.

## Behavior in context

- **Validation:** A validation occurs when a user interacts with a form field, such as submitting a form or moving to the next field.
- **Override behavior:** When multiple validation states are present, only the message with the highest priority state is shown. The order of priority, from lowest to highest, is: valid, info, warning and invalid.

## States

- Default: The initial state of a form field, often before any user interaction or validation.
  - Example: Helper text with password strength requirements.
- Valid: Indicates that the user input meets all validation criteria and is acceptable.
  - Example: User enters a password that meets all the criteria for a strong password.
- Info: Provides additional context or guidance to the user.
  - Example: User changes a field that has a dependency to another field or is not saved yet.
- Warning: A non-critical issue or suggestion related to the input.
  - Examples: User enters a weak password, or a rotation speed that is beyond a safety threshold.
- Invalid: Indicates that the user input does not meet the specified requirements.
  - Examples: User enters an email address without the "@" symbol or misses a required input.

![States](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2767-5681&t=IIgjTqoOEP524yAH-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use short and helpful copy for validation
- Do include all relevant information in the validation message, including context
- Don’t show valid feedback on components, only in the input help component

## Icon button - Usage


Icon buttons are button elements containing only an icon and no text. Due to their small size, icon buttons are often used in complex layouts. We only use icon buttons if a well-known icon is available or the meaning of the icon metaphor is clear from the context.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=6403-7454&t=rJDt18BP7skzAPnM-4)

1. Container
2. Icon

All the variants, options and states of the [button](../button) component apply to the icon button. We’ve listed additional or deviating specifications here.

## Options

- **Color:** The color of the icon displayed on an icon button is adjustable. In our applications, we only adjust the icon color when we place icon buttons on backgrounds with a non-standard color to maintain a proper contrast between the elements.
- **Oval:** The shape of icon buttons can be adjusted from square to oval. The recommended shape of icon buttons depends on the shape of the parent component. We typically use square icon buttons within rectangular components or in a button cluster, and oval icon buttons within oval components.
- **Size:** Icon buttons can have three different sizes. We use the extra small size (12) within very small parent components, the small size (16) within any standard parent components (e.g. to clear the search input) and the default size (24) for standalone applications.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use icons that have a clear meaning for the user, otherwise use text buttons
- Don’t use icon buttons in large numbers, instead use a toolbar
- Don’t stretch icon buttons to span a container’s width

## Input - Usage


Input fields are commonly used in forms, search bars and other areas where data input is required.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3054-593&t=jhhv5OZGqmBpgXcs-4)

1. Label
2. Required indicator
3. Placeholder
4. Slot-end
5. Slot-start
6. Container
7. Helper or feedback text
8. Counter

## Options

- **Label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Slot options:** Add optional elements at the end and/or start of the input field, e.g. an icon, a button or a text option. We typically use slots for additional indications, options or information like a visibility toggle in a password field.
- **Placeholder**: Use a placeholder to provide a hint about what to enter or additional relevant context while the input field is empty. We typically use a placeholder when the label is not visible or we need to provide additional context.
- **Text alignment:** See [form field](../forms-field) (by default at start).
- **Helper text:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Counter:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).

## Behavior in context

- **Validation:** See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Interaction**: Clicking in the container enables the editing of the field.
- **Text truncation**: The text in an input field is cut off with the length of the container.
- **Alignment**: Inputs are always aligned to the left, while right alignment is reserved exclusively for [number fields](../input-number).

## States

The input field has five states: default, focused, hover, disabled and read-only. In the read-only state, the input field is displayed without offering any user interaction.

![Field States](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3198-7167&t=jhhv5OZGqmBpgXcs-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use helper text to guide users through the input process

## Number input - Usage


The number input component is commonly used in forms, calculators and other areas where precise numerical input is required. We typically use the number input component to ensure accurate and efficient data entry.

![Number input overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3805-24565&t=DtCmoFcLwhf7ke3S-4)

1. Label
2. Required field indicator
3. Value
4. Stepper buttons
5. Input field
6. Helper or feedback text

## Options

- **Show text as tooltip**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Placeholder**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Text alignment:** See [form field](../forms-field) (by default at end).
- **Allowed characters pattern**: Specify the characters allowed for input. We typically use this to reject invalid characters, such as decimal points. When users type an invalid character, a shaking animation is immediately triggered.
- **Pattern**: Define the expected input using regular expressions, such as an integer between 1 and 100. We often use this to validate the input when the user leaves the field or clicks submit.
- **Min/Max**: Specify the minimum and maximum values that can be entered to ensure the input stays within the defined range. We typically use this option to prevent invalid entries and guide users towards acceptable values.
- **Show stepper buttons**: Use these optional controls to increment or decrement the value (suitable for small ranges with few steps). We typically use these buttons when precise adjustments are needed, such as in quantity selectors, rating systems or form inputs requiring fine-tuned numerical values.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** Users can type a value or use stepper buttons to adjust it. We recommend using stepper buttons, especially for touch interactions, to enhance usability and precision.
- **Validation:** See [form field](../forms-validation).
- **Overflow:** Numbers are truncated to fit within the input field. Ensure that the expected value is visible in the input field so it can be properly displayed.
- **Alignment:** Number inputs are always aligned to the right.
- **Display format:** After losing focus, scientific notations are converted into standard numeric formats, e.g. 1e3 becomes 1000, 1e-3 becomes 0.001.
## States

The number input has five states: default, hover, focused, disabled and read-only.
![Number input states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=4097-1041&t=lGjPn4Q9U7Fa81TI-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

## Layout grid - Usage


With layout grids, a two-dimensional layout system is available to create responsive layouts. Our layout grids are made of three elements: a grid, row(s) and column(s). The layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation.

Commonly, the layout grid is based on a 12 column layout. Columns are nested in rows and adapt in width according to the available space. Content is placed within columns. Column widths are set as percentage.

![Layout grid overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=800-2637&mode=design&t=R26qUrZCUTY2iIxG-1)

1. Layout grid
2. Row
3. Column
4. Gutter
5. Margin

## Options

## Layout grid options

- The default number of columns in a grid is 12. It is possible to choose any number of columns between 2 and 12.
- Layout grids contain horizontal margins. For smaller viewports or when used within a component, the margin can be removed or reduced.
- As a general rule, a gutter of `1.5rem` is applied. The gutter can be decreased to allow for a narrower grouping of columns.

## Column options

- The size of a column is defined by the available space and the number of columns. If no size is set, columns automatically have equal width. The size of a column can be adjusted so that it takes a higher percentage of the available space. The size property refers to the number of columns from the default of 12 per row.

Example: In a 12 column layout with 6 columns with equal width in place, each column takes a space of 1/6 (or 2 out of 12). When setting the size of the first column to `3` (corresponding to 3 out of 12), the remaining columns adjust their width to fit within the remaining space of 3/4 (or 9 out of 12).

![Example for column size option](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=796-3&mode=design&t=R26qUrZCUTY2iIxG-1)

- A column size `auto` is available. When set to `auto`, column width is defined by the width of its content. The remaining columns resize to fill the row.
- Column size can be tailored to viewports. Three viewports are currently supported. The viewport size can't be adjusted at this point. When setting the size for one viewport, larger viewports are adjusted in the same way.

| Viewport name | Viewport size | Description                        |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Small         | 0-767         | set columns when min width is 0    |
| Medium        | 768-1279      | set columns when min width is 768  |
| Large         | 1280+         | set columns when min width is 1280 |

Example: Here is an example of a 12 column layout grid with 4 columns, each with equal width. The columns' `size` is set to `12` and for medium viewports and larger (`size md`) it is set to `3`. On small viewports, the columns take the full width and stack vertically. For medium and large viewports, columns take equal width.

![Example for viewport-based column sizes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=800-23920&mode=design&t=R26qUrZCUTY2iIxG-1)

## Behavior in context

Decreasing and increasing the viewport width influences the width of each column within a layout grid. When column width is decreased to the point that the minimum content width is reached for at least one column, the layout breaks into a second line.

## Options

- **Target:** Define where a link opens (see [official MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#target)):
    - `_self`: Opens the target in the same tab.
    - `_blank`: Opens the target in a new tab.
    - `_parent`: Opens the target in the parent frame.
    - `_top`: Opens the target in the full body of the window.
- **URL:** Specify the link destination.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** Link buttons can be triggered by pressing anywhere within the button area. When link buttons are focused, they can be triggered by pressing `Enter`.
- **Placement:** We typically place link buttons below or next to related content but not within paragraphs. It's also possible to place multiple link buttons on top of each other to create link lists.
- **Line length:** Link buttons cannot support line break or text truncation. Link button texts are displayed in one line. If there is not enough space, the complete link text is not visible.

## States

Link buttons take five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. On hover, the link destination is shown. In a disabled state, link buttons are visually displayed but don’t offer any user interaction.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use link buttons for navigation
- Don’t use link buttons to indicate actions
- Don’t place link buttons within a paragraph

## Loading modal - usage


Loading modals communicate that the system is performing an operation that takes time and that users should wait. Use them for short blocking tasks (upload, processing) where users should not interact with the page until completion.

![Loading modal](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7351-4017&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4)

1. Spinner
2. Message

## Options

- **Message**: Provide a concise, contextual message that explains what is happening (e.g. "Uploading files" instead of "Loading", see [writing guidelines](../../guidelines/language/dialogs-and-buttons)).

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** Loading modals open and close automatically to prevent user interaction.
- **Overflow:** If the message exceeds the available width, it breaks into multiple lines.
- **Placement:** Horizontally top-aligned, vertically centered.
- **Responsiveness:** Loading modals adjust their width depending on the screen width.

## States

Loading modals have two states: Closed and opened.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do only use if any user interaction needs to be blocked, otherwise use [spinners](../spinner) instead
- Do use if user interaction needs to be blocked and the progress is unknown, otherwise use [progress indicators](../progress-indicator) placed in [custom modals](../modal) instead

- Don’t block users for long tasks without an alternative
- Don’t show vague messages that leave users unsure what is happening

## Message modal - usage

import { IxButton } from '@siemens/ix-react';

# Message modal - usage

Message modals present short messages, confirmations or important alerts that require a decision or acknowledgment. Use them for confirmations, simple decisions and critical alerts that need user action before proceeding.

![Message modal](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7349-215&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4)

1. Icon
2. Title
3. Close button
4. Message
5. Cancel action
6. Confirm action

## Variants

- **Error:** Use for system failures, validation issues or blocking errors.
- **Info:** Use for neutral information, instructions or notifications.
- **Question:** Use for confirmations requiring user decisions.
- **Success:** Use for completed actions when another action is needed, e.g. download backup or copy generated link.
- **Warning:** Use for potential issues or action consequences, e.g. overwrite files.

![Message modal variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7376-535&t=APgwguIwWKMbj5sA-4)

## Options

- **Title:** Use a clear, outcome-oriented title (e.g. "Delete item", see [writing guidelines](/docs/guidelines/language/dialogs-and-buttons)).
- **Message:** Include if you need to provide additional information, e.g. consequences (see [writing guidelines](/docs/guidelines/language/messaging/error-messages)).
- **Confirm action:** Use precise action text, e.g. "Delete", "Confirm", or "Continue".
- **Cancel action:** Use "Cancel" or "Close". We recommend returning to the previous context the user was in.
- **Close on backdrop click:** Enable clicking on the backdrop to close modals for informational messages. Disable for critical decisions that require confirmation.

Note that the choice of button variant is independent from the modal variant, e.g.:

| Visual                                                                                               | Content and buttons                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Error](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7351-3560&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4) | **Title:** A system error occurred**Variant:** Error**Buttons:** Subtle primary button "Reload" and primary button "Try again" |
| ![Question delete](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7351-3731&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4) | **Title:** Deleting this item cannot be undone**Variant:** Question**Buttons:** Primary danger button "Delete" and primary ghost button "Cancel" |
| ![Question discard](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7351-3947&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4) | **Title:** Do you want to save your changes before leaving?**Variant:** Question**Buttons:** Primary button "Save changes", secondary button "Cancel" and tertiary button "Discard" |

Since our web component offers a predefined cancel and confirm action use [modals](../modal) if you intend to adapt the button arrangement or variants.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** See [custom modal behavior](../modal/guide.md#behavior-in-context).
- **Placement:** Horizontally centered, vertically top-aligned.

## States

Message modals have two states: Closed and opened.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use action labels that describe the result (avoid Yes or No)
- Do communicate consequences clearly for destructive actions
- Do keep messages short and scannable

- Don’t use message modals for non-essential information, use [toasts](../toast) instead
- Don’t hide confirm actions behind ambiguous labels

## Custom modal - Usage


Custom modals present rich, contextual content, e.g. forms, complex workflows or nested interactions that require the user's focus.

Use custom models when a task requires immediate attention and the user returns to the same place after closing the modal.

![Modal overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7350-2529&t=WHbXyipgpGwQbVsV-4)

1. Title
2. Close button
3. Modal header
4. Modal content
5. Modal footer

## Options

- **Centered**: Center content by default; use top alignment for tall dialogs that expand during interaction.
- **Size**: Choose an appropriate size based on context and device:
    - **Fixed max-width (360-840px):** Use as default for most layouts. Note that on narrower screens or viewports, the modal scales down and becomes proportionally narrower to fit the available space.
    - **Full width:** Use for data-heavy interfaces on desktop, e.g. large datasets.
    - **Full screen:** Since the modal container covers the whole [application](../application) (including [menu](../application-menu) and [header](../application-header)), use for immersive experiences or multi-step workflows. Note that users have no visual connection to the app which is why we recommend establishing it in the title or content.
- **Backdrop**: Use a backdrop to focus attention and prevent background interaction.
- **Animation**: By default, modals fade in. Disable for performance-sensitive contexts.
- **Close on backdrop click**: Enable clicking on the backdrop to close modals for informational messages. Disable for critical decisions that require confirmation.
- **Before dismiss**: Add follow-up actions when users try to close modals, e.g. add a confirmation prompt to avoid unintentional discarding of inputs when closing.
- **Modal header:**
    - **Title**: Use a short, specific title that describes the task or decision.
    - **Icon and icon color:** Repeat icons from the trigger to establish a connection (e.g. if a button with label and icon opens the modal then reuse the same label and icon). Use [iX theme colors](../../styles/colors).
    - **Hide close**: We recommend only hiding the close button for critical flows that require an explicit decision.
- **Modal footer:** Place one primary, one secondary and optionally one tertiary [button](../button) on the right side to follow the Z-shape reading pattern in left-to-right languages.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:**
    - Modals are opened by the system (e.g. when another process finishes) or by users (e.g. when clicking buttons).
    - Modals are closed:
        - When clicking on close or on buttons in the footer (typically cancel or confirm).
        - When pressing the Escape key.
        - If enabled, when clicking outside the modal (on the backdrop).
    - Focus moves into the modal when it opens and returns to the trigger when it closes.
- **Overflow:**
    - The modal height increases with content until reaching screen height, then a scrollbar appears.
    - We recommend implementing a sticky footer when content overflows.
    - Avoid horizontal scrollbars by using a larger modal size and defining adaptive behaviors for different viewports.
- **Placement:** Horizontally centered, vertically centered or top-aligned.
- **Responsiveness:**
    - Height: Depends on its content except for `full-screen`.
    - Content: Needs to be built responsively to adapt with the container's width.

## States

Modals have two states: Closed and opened.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do provide at least one visible way to close the modal
- Do provide a clear primary action that describes the result
- Do ensure all controls are accessible by keyboard and screen‑reader
- Do preserve scroll position and page state when closing
- Do return users to the previous state when cancelling, not an unrelated page

- Don’t use modals if a decision should be made (use [message modals](../message-modal) instead)
- Don’t nest modals, e.g. to load more data, instead use [spinners](../spinner) within modal contents)
- Don’t auto close modals for irreversible actions
- Don’t overload the modal with unrelated content

## Panes - Usage


Panes have a header and a content area. When collapsed, panes are either hidden or reduced to a bar. In our applications, we often include contextual information, options, trees and lists inside panes.

Panes help users focus on tasks as related controls are visually grouped and the main content has less information. They are also beneficial for compact and hierarchically organized content and provide a more dynamic layout.

![Pane overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1680-22044&mode=design&t=iP7h44Wf17P209P7-4)

1. Left pane, inline
2. Top pane, inline
3. Right pane, floating
4. Bottom pane, inline

## Options

- **Heading**: Set a headline for the pane (we normally use a short content description).
- **Icon**: Panes can display an icon in the pane header next to the title.
- **Composition**: Panes can be positioned on the left, top, right or bottom. We often use left panes for structuring components like trees or lists, and right panes for contextual information. Top and bottom panes are less common in our applications, but can help communicate a clear "top to bottom" hierarchy.
- **Size**: Sizes can be picked either as a fixed size (in pixels) or as a relative size (in percentage) depending on the intended layout. However, picking sizes only applies to medium and large screens as small screen panes are always displayed in full screen (see responsiveness below for more information). We usually choose a pane width and height that avoids the need for scrolling in our applications.
- **Borderless**: Panes can have borders to visually split them from other content areas. We typically use borderless panes when placed within layouts that already have other visual means to split areas.
- **Hide on collapse**: Define whether a pane is visible in its collapsed state. If it is visible, it has a bar appearance when collapsed that contains both the title and the expand button. We usually use inline panes with a collapsible option and floating panes without since they are triggered from a dedicated control like a button or a list item.
- **Variant**: When used within a layout, floating panes are placed above (z-axis) the main content but below the navigation menu and header. When expanded, they cover a part of the main content. Inline panes are placed on one level with the main content. When expanded, they move the main content and reduce its available space.
- **Layout**: Depending on which pane needs more focus, the top/bottom or left/right panes can use more space.

![Pane layouts](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1681-28910&mode=design&t=iP7h44Wf17P209P7-4)

1. Full height (left/right)
2. Full width (top/bottom)

## Behavior

- **Interaction**: Users expand panes that are collapsible by pressing on the expand button. To expand panes with hidden collapsed state, users typically click on a button or another interactive component within the main content. They close these panes by either pressing on the button on the right side of the header or clicking outside the pane area. This removes the pane from their view.
- **Overflow**: When content extends the available space within the pane, scrollbars appear. Headers stay fixed at the top allowing users to scroll the content area. We like to avoid overfilling panes with content to remove the need for scrolling.
- **Stacking**: When users expand multiple panes within a pane layout, panes are stacked.
- **Placement**: We typically fit a pane layout within the complete content area of a page bounded by the application header on top and the navigation menu on the left.
- **Responsiveness**: On large and medium size screens, all panes have a maximum width or height of `50%` of the available space. On small screens, all panes have full width and expand to full height, but the header and navigation menu remain visible. We show collapsed left and right panes on the top and bottom for a more efficient use of space.

![Pane small viewport](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1680-26548&mode=design&t=iP7h44Wf17P209P7-4)

1. Inline panes in collapsed state
2. Inline or floating pane in expanded state
3. Opened navigation menu

## States

Panes have two states: collapsed and expanded. The appearance of the states varies between variants and screen sizes.

## Dos and Don’ts

## Pill - Usage


Pills typically contain a concise label and sometimes an icon. They are not clickable or closable, making them ideal for presenting static information succinctly within an application.

![Pill overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1377-3110&mode=design&t=ZmcRP4ggXtr8b7vZ-1)

1. Container
2. Icon
3. Label text

## Variants

With our pill variants, you can apply different colors based on their purpose, importance or context. We use pill variants to show class, status and levels of importance. The custom variant is often used for pills that visualize a high number of different categories.

Pill variants:

- **Primary**: For high visual emphasis.
- **State-related variants**: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info and neutral.
- **Custom**: For a customized background and label color.

![Pill variants](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1375-1985&mode=design&t=ZmcRP4ggXtr8b7vZ-1)

## Options

- **Align left**: Position the pill content to the left side.
- **Background**: Use to set a custom background color when you require more flexibility in styling the pill. Only available for the custom pill variant.
- **Color**: Customize font and icon color for pill. This allows users to specify a unique font color in combination with a custom background color (only applicable when the variant is set to 'custom').
- **Icon**: Pills can include a close icon within the element which is positioned before the pill label.
- **Outline**: Use for lower visual emphasis.
- **Width**: Pill width can be set to a specific value, but content length normally determines pill width with a minimum width of '2rem'.
- **Tooltip text**: Provide a specific text to be displayed as the tooltip or set the attribute without a specific value to display the pill's text content.

## Behavior

- **Placement**: We usually position pills inline with other elements to convey their status or category. We do not place pills within input and filter components as these already contain similar components. However, it’s possible to add components similar to pills to tabs and navigation menu items. These counter or notification components are provided as component options.
- **Text truncation**: When you set a width for pills, long labels are truncated to fit the available space.

## States

Pills are read-only.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use pills to communicate tags and categories
- Do use pills to indicate the status or characteristics of an item
- Don’t overuse pills as this leads to cluttered and overwhelming interfaces
- Don’t use different styles for pills with the same or similar use
- Don’t use pills if users can interact with the component (e.g. click, close) use chips instead

## Popover news - Usage


Use the popover news component to present news and information when the application starts like release notes, new app features or marketing-related information. For Siemens applications, provide the information within the [About and legal overlay](../about-and-legal) as well.

![Popover news](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1013-70517&mode=design&t=Ntzn8IlSOlPey8s5-11)

- (1) Header text
- (2) Close button
- (3) Content
- (4) "Show more" button takes users to another place in the app to learn more about the information given
- (5) Spike shows popover origin

## Options

- **label:** Defines the header text of the popover news (1)|
- **i18nShowMore:** Adjusts the text of the "Show more" button (4) |
- **offsetBottom:** Adjusts the popover position. The spike (5) should point to the info icon.

## Behavior

Unlike a modal, popover news does not prevent users from navigating and interacting with the content. It only overlays the content partially and appears once triggered by the app. As soon as the user closes the popover, it does not appear again until it is re-triggered. Therefore we recommend that the information should be additionally available in the [About and legal overlay](../about-and-legal). The popover spike should always point to the information icon so users can find the information again. The `offsetBottom` option can be used to control its exact position.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use popover news for "nice to know" information
- Don‘t use popover news for essential information a user must read, instead use a [modal](../messagebar)
- Don‘t use popover news for system feedback or messages, instead use a [modal](../toast)

## Progress indicator - Usage


Progress indicators inform users about the status of ongoing measurable processes, e.g. loading data, submitting forms or processing non-blocking operations (for indeterminate processes use [spinners](../spinner/index.mdx) instead).

![Progress indicator anatomy](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=2094-345&t=pq3AmdWOVOjIx4S4-4)

1. Label
2. Helper text
3. Fill
4. Track
5. Content slot

The basic anatomy of progress indicators consists of a value indicator moving along a background track. The track represents the total expected length while the fill shows the current progress.

## Variants

Progress indicator variants (types):
- **Linear:** Use for horizontal layouts or when the progress value should be more visible.
- **Circular:** Use for compact or centered layouts, e.g. when it’s replacing an icon.

## Options

- **Status:** Use the status to reflect the outcome or current condition of a process:
	- Default: Normal, ongoing process without special attention needed
	- Success: Process completed successfully
	- Info: Process ongoing with low-impact additional information, e.g. "Compressing files before upload"
	- Warning: Process ongoing but needs attention, e.g. "Storage space is running low"
	- Error: Process interrupted or failed, e.g. due to network connection problems
	- Paused: Process temporarily stopped by the system or by the user, e.g. by pressing a button
- **Alignment:** By default, the label, control and helper text are left-aligned. Use the centered option to accommodate layouts with vertical reading patterns, e.g. low-width containers.
- **Label:** Add a label to describe the process being tracked, helping users understand what operation is in progress.
- **Helper text:** Use helper text to provide additional context, e.g. percentage completed, estimated time remaining or errors that happened during the process.
- **Show text as tooltip:** This option hides the helper text and displays it only when the user hovers or focuses the progress indicator.
- **Size:** Progress indicators are available in five predefined heights: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl`.
- **Value, min and max:** The progress range is customizable. By default, it spans from 0 to 100. Adjust the min and max values to suit your specific use case.
- **Content slot:** Use this slot to display additional content such as percentage values or custom elements like icons.

:::info
For more information about writing effective helper texts or labels, see our [UX writing guidelines](../../guidelines/language/basics.md).
:::
## Behavior in context

- **Resizing:** The total width of progress indicators is `24rem` by default. Customize it to your context.
- **Text overflow:** If the helper text or label are too long for the available horizontal space, it has a line-break.
- **Slot:** Slots in linear progress indicators have a min-width of `2.25rem` to accommodate using values from 0% to 100% without changing the width of the actual bar.

![progress indicator resizing](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5650-16162&t=pq3AmdWOVOjIx4S4-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use progress indicators consistently for similar processes
- Do use progress indicators for determinate processes where progress can be measured (otherwise use [spinners](../spinner/index.mdx))
- Do use linear progress indicators in horizontal layouts and circular indicators in compact spaces or centered layouts
- Do keep your slot content short, especially for the centered alignment (use helper texts and labels for lengthier content)

- Don't use progress indicators for operations shorter than one second
- Don't only indicate progress completion with the indicator without clear task messages, e.g. success toasts or displaying the loaded content

## Radio - Usage


Radio buttons are presented in groups to signify that only one selection is allowed at a time. Selecting a radio button automatically deselects any previously chosen radio button within the same group. We typically use radio buttons to offer users a set of exclusive choices.

![Anatomy radio button](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3384-108&t=GDd4aJQUrPB3cC9X-4)

1. Label
2. Required indicator
3. Radio button group
4. Helper or feedback text
5. Radio button
6. Radio button label

## Options

- **Label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).

## Behavior in context

- **Validation**: Radio buttons are validated collectively, not individually. For more information on validation, see [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Interaction**: Clicking on a radio button toggles its state between checked and unchecked/default. Every other radio button in the group is automatically unchecked.

## States

![States radio button](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3387-8703&t=ZvZOV5vvqWRxmqyv-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use radio buttons when the user needs to select only one option from a set of options
- Do group related radio buttons together to indicate that only one option can be selected at a time
- Do provide a default (already selected) option when the user first sees the radio button group
- Don’t use radio buttons if the user needs to select multiple options from a set of options - use a checkbox instead
- Don’t use only one radio button in a group, groups should have at least two options

## Select - Usage


The select component supports single or multiple selections and the editable variant allows users to add new items. We typically use select components in forms, filters and settings where users need to choose from predefined options.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3647-6332&t=DtCmoFcLwhf7ke3S-4)

1. Label
2. Required indicator
3. Placeholder
4. Clear button
5. Open dropdown button
6. Container
7. Dropdown list
8. List header
9. Selected list item
10. Editable mode (add new items)

## Options

- **Label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Placeholder:** Use a placeholder to provide information about what to enter or additional relevant context while the input field is empty. We typically use a placeholder when the label is not visible or we need to provide additional context.
- **Helper text:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Show clear button:** Select components can have a dedicated button to easily clear the selection. Hide the button when offering users other ways to reset, e.g. a default item like "none", or if you aim for simplified keyboard accessibility.
- **List header:** Use an optional header to provide additional context or instructions about the items to help users understand choices better.
- **Information for no matches:** Set a message to be displayed when no item matches the inserted text.
- **Editable:** When enabled, users can add new items to the list.
- **Multiselect:** Allow users to select multiple items from the list.
  - **Collapse multiple selections:** When enabled, selected items are collapsed into a counter instead of showing all selected items.
- **Items:**
  - **Label:** Set a short and concise label for dropdown items.
  - **Selected:** Mark selected items in the dropdown with a check mark.

## Behavior in context

- **Validation:** See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Interaction:**
  - Click or Enter key on button opens dropdown list.
  - Typing in the input field filters the dropdown list.
  - Arrow keys navigate within the dropdown list.
  - Click or Enter selects a highlighted list item.
  - Escape key closes dropdown list and returns to the originally selected value.
- **Overflow:**
  - The text in an input field is truncated with the length of the container.
  - On the multiselect, the selected items break into a second line and then show a scrollbar if it extends beyond two lines.
  - The dropdown list is scrollable when the list exceeds the container height. Its width is defined by the longest item. The maximum width of the dropdown list is set to 100% by default. Use the properties `dropdownWidth` and `dropdownMaxWidth` to customize the dimensions.
- **Alignment:** Selects are always aligned to the left, while right alignment is reserved exclusively for [number inputs](../input-number).

## States

The select field has five states: default, hover, focused, disabled and read-only. In the disabled state, the input field is displayed without offering any user interaction.

![Field states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3960-760&t=MWpyPDZDK5B531n9-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do consider performance when loading an extensive list of items
- Do use the select component when there is a finite list of items available to avoid manual input errors or duplicates
- Do sort items logically, e.g. alphabetically or numerically
- Don’t use selects for binary choices, like yes and no, use [radio buttons](../toggle) instead
- Don’t use selects for navigational or search patterns, use [category filters](../expanding-search) instead
- Don’t combine several data attributes in an item label, use [HTML tables](../html-grid) or [AG Grids](../grid) with a search functionality instead

![Don’t combine data attributes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3978-800&t=MWpyPDZDK5B531n9-4)

## Settings - Usage


The settings component appears when users click on the "settings" icon (1). It overlays the current content and closing this overlay brings users back to the original content.

![Settings overlay](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1030-80408&mode=design&t=Ntzn8IlSOlPey8s5-11)

- (1) Settings icon: opens and closes the settings overlay
- (2) Content header: default string is "Settings" and can be replaced
- (3) Close button: closes overlay
- (4) Tabs (optional): navigates through multiple settings categories
- (5) Content

## Behavior

The overlay opens on top of the application content. The overlay has a semi-transparent background with a background blur effect to emphasize the overlay character. Closing this overlay brings users back to previous content.

The overlay can be closed in three ways:

- Use the close button
- Click the settings icon again
- Click another navigation item

---

## Split button - Usage


Split buttons consist of two parts: a button labeled with text and/or an icon on the left and a dropdown button labeled with an icon on the right. We typically use split buttons when a default action is available but more options need to be offered. Split buttons group similar or related actions.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5888-8071&t=rJDt18BP7skzAPnM-4)

1. Button
2. Dropdown button
3. Button icon
4. Button label
5. Dropdown button icon

All the variants, options and states of the [button](../button/index.mdx) and the [dropdown button](../dropdown-button/index.mdx) components apply to the split button. We've listed additional or deviating specifications here.

## Options

- **Label:** Set a label for the button component (left side). We typically use short labels that contain a verb.
- **Placement:** Define where the flyout appears which is triggered when the dropdown button is active. You can choose between different directions (top, bottom, left, right) and two options for alignment with the button (start, end). When there is not enough space for the chosen setting, the placement is corrected automatically.
- **Split icon:** We typically use a chevron icon on the dropdown button, but a custom icon can be set. A common alternative to the chevron is the "more-menu" icon.

The options **loading** and **type** are not available for split buttons.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** When users press an option from the dropdown list, the action is triggered. Typically the label of the button on the left side stays static. Be aware that updating the left side with the last triggered action may lead to layout changes (e.g. button width) and requires updating the dropdown by adding the action that was removed from the button face.

## States

Split buttons have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. States are applied to left and the right part of the split button independently. The visual appearance and the behavior of the states is the same as the [button](../button) and the [dropdown button](../dropdown-button).

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use split buttons when there is a frequent or most-important action
- Don’t use split buttons for unrelated actions
- Don’t duplicate the default option in the dropdown

## Textarea - Usage


The textarea component is typically used in scenarios such as feedback forms, comment sections and message composition. Its ability to handle extensive text input makes it a versatile tool for collecting detailed user information.

![Textarea overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3814-1128&t=DtCmoFcLwhf7ke3S-4)

1. Label
2. Required field indicator
3. Placeholder
4. Container
5. Resize handle
6. Helper or feedback text
7. Counter

## Options

- **Label**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Value**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Required**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Show text as tooltip**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Placeholder**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Counter**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Resize behavior**: Determines how textareas can be resized (both directions, horizontally, vertically, or no resizing). Default size is 300px x 100px.
- **Columns and width**: Defines initial width by number of columns and/or width.
- **Rows and height**: Defines initial height by number of rows and/or height.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction**:
  - Clicking in the container enables the editing of the field.
  - Users can type, copy, paste and cut text within textareas.
  - Optional: Users can resize textareas to fit their needs. For example, vertical resizing can be useful in feedback forms when the entry exceeds the default height.
- **Validation**:
  - Minimum and maximum length defines number of characters allowed.
  - See [form validation](../forms-validation).
- **Overflow**: Text within the textarea is not truncated; it supports scrolling for overflow content.
- **Alignment**: Text is always left-aligned in textareas.
- **Sizing**:
  - Use columns and rows when you want to define the size of the textarea based on the number of characters (columns) and lines (rows) it can display. This is particularly useful for textareas where the content length is predictable, such as input fields with character limits.
  - Use width and height when you need to specify the exact dimensions of the textarea in terms of pixels, rems or other units. This is ideal for ensuring consistent layout and design across different screen sizes and devices, especially in responsive designs.

## States

Textareas have five states: Default, hover, focused, read-only and disabled.

![Textarea states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3947-527&t=DtCmoFcLwhf7ke3S-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do ensure the textarea size matches the expected input, e.g. 5 to 10 rows for detailed feedback
- Do use the placeholder to give users an example of the expected input
- Do set minimum and maximum character limits to ensure appropriate input length
- Don’t use the textarea for short, single-line input like name or email address, use an [input field](../input) instead

## Time picker - Usage


Time pickers are primarily used within [time inputs](../input-time) but can also be utilized standalone in applications where direct time selection is required.

![Time picker anatomy](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5730-2889&t=X5f645XuQl3ZV8XD-4)

1. Time picker container
2. Time unit (column) headers
3. Selected time
4. AM/PM select (12-hour format only)
5. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Value**: The selected time value.
- **Format**: Choose which time units to display, depending on your needs (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds). Additionally, define a 12- or 24-hour format. We recommend to use a 24-hour format for universal readability (read more in the [UX writing guides](./../../guidelines/language/writing-style-guide-getting-started)).
  - **Columns**: Hide hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds columns when not needed.
  - **Intervals**: Define an interval for every unit to restrict allowed values and provide a faster selection. For example 2 hours, 15 minutes, 30 seconds, 100 milliseconds.
- **Header**: Define a header text that conveys the context of the time selection. Hide it when there is already a related headline in your UI.
- **Corners**: By default, the time picker shows rounded corners to be consistent with the [dropdown](../dropdown). Use straight, left or right corners to combine with other components.
- **Standalone appearance**: Shows a flat design without a shadow. We typically use it for inline placement.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction**: Users can navigate through the time picker using the keyboard. The following keys are supported:
  - **Tab**: Navigate between areas of the time picker (header, body, footer).
  - **Arrow keys or scroll**: Move through time options.
  - **Enter or click**: Select the highlighted time.

## States

An individual time item of a time picker has five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused.

![Time picker states](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5730-2897&t=ZhOOQlwBUWtHJWDA-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use the time picker to ensure accurate time selection (we recommend to use [time inputs](../input-time) for that reason)
- Do provide clear instructions and labels for users
- Do ensure the time picker is accessible via keyboard

- Don’t clutter the time picker with unnecessary options

## Toast - Usage


Toasts are UI elements where an event causes a small text field to appear on screen. Toasts are informative, last for a few seconds only, and take up a very small part of the screen to avoid interrupting the workflow. They usually follow an action performed by the user and provide information about the success or failure of that action. We typically use toasts for immediate feedback or tips on actions that a user performs, e.g. successful deletion.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2550-58743&t=LITgbzwcgm87dQXa-4)

1. Icon
2. Button
3. Progress bar
4. Header
5. Message
6. Close action

## Options

- **Toast types:** There are four preset toast types and one custom type:
  - Info: Provides users with additional information about the performed action.
  - Success: Informs users of a successfully performed action.
  - Warning: Warns users of potential problems that could occur due to the action.
  - Error: Notifies users that the action cannot be performed due to a specific problem.
  - Custom: Adjust the icon and its color to customize your own toast messages.
- **Header:** Add a header for the toast. Use short and concise words. We typically use 1 to 3 keywords, such as "Error occurred" or "Action completed".
- **Message:** Add a clear and concise message providing more detailed information about the toast event. We typically provide additional context or instructions related to the event, e.g. "Please check your email for further instructions" or "Your changes have been saved successfully".
- **Button:** Include a button to provide users with an option to take further action. We typically use a button to give the user an option to undo the action or to provide a link for further information.
- **Position:** Toasts are positioned either at the bottom or top right. The default position is bottom right. This position is configured globally, which means all toasts appear from the same position. We typically change the default position if the toast covers important workflow elements.

![Toast types](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2552-64766&t=VfiuoHWd1VYl1GYb-4)

## Behavior in context

- **Auto closure:** Toasts should only be displayed on the screen for a few seconds. A progress bar is displayed to visualize the time left until the toast disappears. We typically leave the toast on the screen from 3 to 8 seconds.
- **Manual closure:** Toasts can be closed manually at any time. It's also possible to suppress the automatic closing so that the user has to actively close the toast. We normally use a purely manual closure of the toast if the workflow is continued by using the toast, e.g. downloading files.
- **Multiple toasts:** Toasts are stacked on top of each other with the newest at the bottom.
- **Modal vs. toast:** When both the modal and the toast are triggered simultaneously, the toast appears below the modal. The toast is visible but blurred due to the transparent layer, and it eventually closes if not prevented by the auto-closing option.

![Toast in Context](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=2589-2697&t=Ysb6WohsxOfZv2ls-4)

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use toasts to provide contextual tips and shortcuts for users
- Do use toasts to instantly inform a user about the outcome of an action
- Do include shortcuts to undo an action immediately after it’s taken
- Do stick with a consistent position for toasts within the same app and avoid interchanging their positions
- Don’t use toasts for high-priority or critical alerts that prevent the user from continuing their work (use a [modal](../messagebar) instead)
- Don’t edit or reuse icons or icon colors from the four predefined toast types when creating custom toasts

## Toggle - Usage


A toggle is a user interface element that enables users to switch between two states, such as on/off or enable/disable. It consists of a switch that can be slid or clicked to change its state. They offer a visually clear representation of the current state and allow users to easily toggle between different settings. We typically use toggles in settings, preferences, and other areas where users need to switch between two states quickly and easily.

![Anatomy toggle](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7147-451930&t=DrLi4Tgyh22TBGiT-4)

1. Label
2. Required indicator
3. Toggle
4. Toggle label
5. Helper or feedback text

## Options

- **Label:** See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).

## Behavior in context

- **Validation**: See [validation](../forms-validation).
- **Interaction**: Clicking on the toggle switch changes its state from on to off or vice versa. The toggle visually reflects the current state.

## States

## Toggle button - Usage


Toggle buttons with and without text labels are available. We typically use toggle buttons to switch between states or modes. They are ideal for scenarios where a setting can be turned on or off, or where a selection can be toggled independently of others.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5890-9247&t=p3alxGH4u4utYcc1-4)

Variants, options and states of the [button](../button/index.mdx) and the [icon button](../icon-button/index.mdx) components apply. Only additional, deviating or detailing specifications are listed here.

## Options

- **Pressed:** Toggle buttons can take a pressed (active) state. To improve accessibility, this state is set via the pressed option so it can be read by screen readers.
- The options **type** and **color** are not available for toggle buttons.
- For the default variant, one of the options **secondary** or **tertiary** has to be set.
- **Oval:** The shape of icon toggle buttons can be adjusted from square to oval.

## Behavior in context

- **Independent toggling:** Toggle buttons are typically used on their own or in layouts where each button represents an independent setting or mode. For example, toggling bold, italic or underline in a text editor.

## States

Toggle buttons have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled, loading and focused. All states are also available for pressed toggled buttons.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use toggle buttons when users can switch a setting on or off independently
- Do use toggle buttons when two opposing options don’t follow the on/off metaphor
- Don’t use toggle buttons in button groups where only one option can be selected (use normal [buttons](../button/index.mdx) or [icon buttons](../icon-button/index.mdx) instead)

## Overview

## Our commitment as a design system

We are committed that our deliverables qualify for building solutions that are accessible for everyone. We strive to meet **WCAG AA standards** by providing perceivable, operable, and understandable components that follow our accessibility checklist.

## Ensuring accessibility in products

While our components are designed to meet accessibility standards, it is essential to remember that the overall accessibility of your solutions depends on how these components are used.

Simply incorporating our accessible components does not guarantee that the final product will be fully accessible. It is the responsibility of the developers and designers to ensure that their implementations adhere to accessibility best practices throughout the entire design and development process.

A comprehensible quick reference on how to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).

## WCAG and the key principles

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG covers web sites, applications, and other digital content. It is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). WCAG is an international standard.

The four main guiding principles of accessibility within WCAG are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These overarching principles contain clear guidelines for creating and presenting WCAG-compliant digital content.

There are three levels of conformance:
- Level A is the minimum level.
- Level AA includes all Level A and AA requirements. **We strive to meet Level AA.**
- Level AAA includes all Level A, AA, and AAA requirements.

https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/

## Principle 1: Perceivable

> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### Provide text alternatives

Provide text alternatives for non-text content. It allows content to be adapted into formats that support assistive technology e.g. screen readers ([WCAG reference 1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#text-alternatives)).

- Provide text alternatives for any non-text content, such as icons without text labels
- Provide text content for videos
- Provide captions for figures and tables
- Avoid images containing text

**Example**: Annotate your designs to provide text alternatives when developing.

![Annotations](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18109&t=LutEhcCmwu00FxNT-4)

**Example**: Use ARIA tags to ensure that your content is accessible and understandable to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

| ARIA tag | Description |
| :----------------- | :------------ |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for an element. |
| `aria-labelledby`  | Identifies one or more elements that provide the accessible name for an element. It is often used when the label is already present on the page. |
| `aria-describedby` | Identifies the element that provides a description for the element it is applied to. |

### Create adaptable content

Design and implement content that can be presented in various ways, such as a simpler layout, without losing information or structure. This flexibility allows users to access and understand content regardless of their specific needs or the devices they are using ([WCAG reference 1.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#adaptable)).

- Ensure information is available in text or can be programmatically determined
- Allow both landscape and portrait orientations
- Provide tooltips for data cells to show context in [tables](../../components/html-grid/index.mdx)
- Designate regions like header, main and footer
- Provide related inputs as form
- Annotate reading order

**Example**: [Input components](../../components/forms-field/index.mdx) include optional attributes for label, required indicator, and helper or feedback text, and are usable inside a form.

![Input with labels and helper texts](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18118&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

### Combine color and contrast

In industrial software applications, color significantly enhances the visual communication of information. Nonetheless, it is essential to account for users with limited vision or color blindness. Use color combinations ([WCAG reference 1.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#distinguishable)) that meet accessibility standards for contrast to make it easier for users to see content, including separating foreground from background.

#### Use text on background

- Ensure minimum contrast for body text is 4.5:1
- Ensure minimum contrast for large text is 3:1
- Ensure icons meet 3:1 contrast with the background

**Example**: On background colors 1 to 4, both text colors (std-text and soft-text) pass the WCAG AA criteria for body text, large text, and icons.

![Text colors on background colors](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18230&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

#### Contrast components

While the components in our design system are built to meet baseline contrast requirements, it’s essential to evaluate contrast in the context of their implementation such as background colors or surrounding element.

- Ensure component contrast for adjoining colors is 3:1
- Ensure visual states for components meet 3:1 contrast with adjoining colors
- Ensure data visualization meets 3:1 contrast with the background

**Example**: On background colors 1 to 4, primary [buttons](../../components/button/index.mdx) pass the WCAG AA criteria for default, hover, and active states. For disabled states, the criteria do not apply as inactive components are exempt.

![Component contrast](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18322&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

**Example**: In the [push card component](../../components/card/index.mdx), we adjust the font color based on the card's status color to ensure sufficient contrast.

![Component contrast for push card](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5638-15909&t=LBH5sM5nmqFyILZP-4)

#### Use more than color

- Ensure information conveyed by color is available in text as well

**Example**: The [message bar component](../../components/messagebar/index.mdx) uses color and an icon to indicate the severity level. To be compliant with WCAG, the text matches the severity level and is understandable without the color or the icon.

![Use of color and icon in message bars](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18225&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

## Principle 2: Operable

> User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### Provide keyboard usage

Every feature in your industrial software needs to be operable via a keyboard ([WCAG reference 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#keyboard-accessible)). This approach supports users who prefer or need to use keyboard controls, and cannot rely on mouse or touch.

- Annotate tab order
- Annotate keyboard interaction
- Ensure all components are operable by keyboard
- Follow ARIA keyboard guidance for custom components ([ARIA reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/))

**Example**: Annotate tab order to allow the navigation of interactive elements by pressing the Tab key. The standard behavior follows the reading order from left to right and top to bottom.

![Annotated tab order](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18139&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

**Example**: Note that disabled elements are non-interactive, do not display tooltips, and are ignored by assistive technologies like screen readers.

![Disabled elements non-interactive](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5574-15465&t=LutEhcCmwu00FxNT-4)

### Give enough time

Ensure that users have sufficient time to read and interact with the content in your applications. This consideration is crucial for users working in dynamic environments where interruptions are common ([WCAG reference 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#enough-time)).

- Avoid autoplay content
- Avoid time limits or allow adjustment

**Example**: [Toast messages](../../components/toast/index.mdx) with auto closure visualize the time left until the toast disappears. This auto closure can be paused when hovering over the message.

![Toast messages with auto closure](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18173&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

### Implement navigable aids

Navigation aids help users find content and understand their location within your applications ([WCAG reference 2.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#navigable)). This includes features like breadcrumbs, search functionality, and clear labeling to enhance user experience and efficiency.

- Use headings properly (`` ... ``)
- Provide descriptive page titles
- Provide clear link text
- Provide links to skip blocks
- Provide a search function
- Reduce the use of text styles and decorations

**Example**: Here we have detailed navigation using a [breadcrumb](../../components/breadcrumb/index.mdx), hierarchy of headings and [tab](../../components/tabs/index.mdx) navigation within details.

![Master detail navigation](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18202&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

### Customize input modalities

Enhance the usability of your applications by making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods. This includes supporting keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice inputs to accommodate different user preferences and working conditions ([WCAG reference 2.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.2&currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=246%2C111#input-modalities)).

- Allow for simple pointer actions for all interactions
- Ensure minimum target size of 24x24 pixels
- Provide alternatives to device motion responses
- Allow cancel, undo and reverse for pointer actions

**Example**: The [chip component](../../components/chip/index.mdx), which is clickable, has a minimum height of 32px to ensure it meets accessibility requirements for touch targets. The [pill component](../../components/pill/index.mdx), being non-interactive and used only for displaying status, can have a smaller height.

![Chips and pill](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18208&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

## Principle 3: Understandable

> Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

### Ensure readability and comprehension

Make text content easy to read and understand. Implement straightforward language, legible typography, and organized layout to improve user experience and accessibility ([WCAG reference 3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.2&currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=111%2C241%2C246%2C247%2C322%2C331#readable)).

- Specify the default language of the page in HTML
- Use simple, clear language
- Provide definitions for complex terms

**Tip**: Our [writing guidelines](../../guidelines/language/basics.md) help make applications readable and understandable.

![Wording example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18180&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

### Be predictable

Create consistent and intuitive applications that behave as users expect. Ensure navigation and interactions follow established patterns, helping users to interact with your application without unexpected behavior ([WCAG reference 3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#predictable)).

- Provide clear error messages and correction options
- Provide help mechanisms in the same location
- Use the same icons for identical functions
- Ensure predictable patterns on input and focus
- Keep button styles consistent

**Example**: Using the application frame ensures that the main navigation is always in the same location.

![Application frame](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18219&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

### Give input assistance

Actively assist users in avoiding errors through preventive design and helpful guidance. When mistakes do occur, provide clear, constructive feedback and simple correction options to help users recover and complete their tasks successfully ([WCAG reference 3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.2&currentsidebar=%23col_overview#input-assistance)).

- Provide labels for inputs
- Indicate required fields and provide legends
- Provide expected data formats
- Avoid validation before user exits focus
- Describe errors
- Provide reverse and undo

**Example**: Errors are described using the feedback text of input components.

![Helper and feedback text](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18196&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

## Principle 4: Robust

> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents,including assistive technologies.

Build your application with clean, standards-compliant code that ensures compatibility with browsers, devices and assistive technologies ([WCAG reference 4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C131#compatible)).

- Use proper ARIA labels and roles
- Make status messages programmatically available
- Test with multiple browsers and versions
- Test with assistive technologies
- Test with different zoom levels

**Example**: Test whether content is readable and functional when zooming in to at least 200%, ensuring users with visual impairments can effectively use your application.

![Page zoom](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5402-18199&t=JzJxfVEhA9XmeCtN-4)

## Acknowledging users

# 

## Examples 

![Acknowledging users example 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4329&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4) 

![Acknowledging users example 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4401&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Acknowledging users example 3](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4404&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

In all these examples, the chatbot acknowledges the input and then continues with its response, building user confidence that the chatbot understood their query correctly. 

![Acknowledging users example 4](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4407&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here, although there may be some lag time between the query and the response, the chatbot acknowledges the request and then signals they are working on the task. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use discourse markers to acknowledge users (see grammar section)  
-	Do use interim acknowledgments if the query response takes time to load  
-	Do read out dialogs to test if any acknowledgments are naturally missing  
-	Don’t forget to balance efficiency with authenticity

---

## Ad hoc conversations

#

## Examples

![Apology example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4359&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Universally, chatbots start with an apology before anything else, even if it was the user that added inappropriate or offensive input.

![Extended apology example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4368&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot seeks to move the user back on course and reminds them of their use case.

![Ad hoc question example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4370&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Other ad hoc conversations, such as talking about the weather or saying hello help build a bond between user and chatbot. Although we do not recommend training your chatbot to tell jokes with users in industrial settings, a certain number of ad hoc conversations are beneficial.

Finally, in the face of truly unprofessional and offensive input, the following example from Microsoft Copilot shows a clear set of standards and makes their ethical guidelines transparent:

**Copilot:** As an AI language model, I don’t have personal opinions or feelings, but I am designed to follow ethical guidelines. I **do not** engage in discussions or create content that promotes racism, sexism, or any form of discrimination. If you encounter any inappropriate responses, please let me know, and I'll do my best to address them.
## Dos and Don’ts

- Do consider training your chatbot to filter for a list of offensive terms
-	Do consider localization and cultural nuances, such as “master” and “slave”
-	Do train your chatbot to move users back on track
-	Don’t forget to test and train for offensive user input
-	Don’t forget to allow for some harmless non-work interactions

---

## Confirming requests

# 
 
## Examples 

![Confirming requests negative example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4332&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

This interaction is frustrating and inefficient. It seems as if the chatbot does not trust the request and therefore the user. This would break trust between human and machine and result in a negative user experience. We recommend asking for confirmation only once and, if necessary, giving warnings or alerting users to possible consequences at the same time. 

![Confirming requests positive example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4396&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

In this interaction we see a simple request for confirmation before completing the task. The chatbot clarifies the user knows the consequences and then fulfills the task. In these types of interactions, asking for confirmation has similar advantages to acknowledging users; it further removes doubt and builds user confidence that the chatbot has correctly comprehended the query and is able to respond accurately.  

## Dos and Don’ts

-	Do make all confirmations clear and transparent before processing tasks  
-	Do mitigate risks associated with making changes to systems or processes  
-	Do add warnings and consequences for significant or hazardous changes  
-	Don’t ask for confirmation more than once

---

## Ending conversations

# 

## Examples

![Ending conversations: Short example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4361&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

This is a simple, effective end showing the supportive nature of the chatbot. 

![Ending conversations: Longer example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4365&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

This is a more empathetic ending, highlighting the successful support given and the support it will continue to provide the user. 

![Ending conversations: Example with apology](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4363&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot offers an apology for not being able to support the user, explains why, and then closes with a more positive note to try to compensate for its failure. While this is a negative end to the interaction, providing a clear reason for its limitations and then offering to make amends with the next query, helps soften the disappointment. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do consider adding a time-out feature   
- Do consider adding thumbs up and thumbs down icons to get feedback   
- Don’t loop back and have the chatbot reintroduce themselves

---

## Funneling input

# 

## Examples 

![Funneling example for context 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4341&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Funneling example for context 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4381&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot asks simple questions related to the user's query to gain some context to better help them. 

![Funneling example for clarification 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4384&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)
    
![Funneling example for clarification 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4387&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

The chatbot needed to verify the user queries in both these examples and sought clarification before trying to give them an appropriate response.  

![Funneling example with choices 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4390&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Funneling example with choices 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4393&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Presenting options or choices for the user to select from also helps to funnel queries and show users what the chatbot can do for them. We recommend limiting the options to two or three to not overload the user. 

## Dos and Don’ts

-	Do train your chatbot to guide users to their point  
-	Do test your chatbot with vague queries   
-	Don’t assume users know what to ask for

---

## Greeting users

# 

## Examples

![Greeting users with a simple introduction](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4327&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot uses “Hello” instead of “Hi” or another greeting to establish a more professional tone. It also uses contractions (I’m instead of I am) to show that, although it’s a professional industrial chatbot, they’re not overly formal. The greeting then ends with a clear and common prompt for the user. 

![Greeting users with an extended introduction](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4410&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4) 

In this example, the greeting adds some information about its use case to set user expectations and limit their queries.

![Greeting users with extended use case introduction](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4412&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4) 

This example goes even further to establish what it can do and how it can help. It isn’t too lengthy, it’s not a monologue or a list of points that would overwhelm users and perfectly narrows down its abilities. 

![Greeting users with an informal introduction](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4414&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

This chatbot is less formal, more conversational and would be found within more generic chatbots. We do not recommend this style of greeting for our industrial applications that are embedded in working environments that are often demanding and dangerous. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do keep your greeting short and simple  
-	Do check every word matches your brand  
-	Don’t add a list of bullet points explaining what the chatbot can do   
-	Don’t use slang or idiomatic language in your greeting

---

## Handing off users

#  

## Examples

![Handing off to human assistance example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4347&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot is polite, professional and after a couple of clarifying questions, they admit to being unable to help and hand them off the best person to support them with their issue. They also make it clear they are being handed off to a human. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do ensure support features are current and live   
- Do be transparent when your chatbot is handing users over    
-	Don’t try more than 3 times to ask for clarification; know when to hand off

---

## Handling errors

# 

## Examples 

![Handling errors example apology](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4344&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot is immediately apologetic and tells the user they cannot complete the task. It’s efficient but lacks empathy and fails to give the user any kind of alternative support. 

![Handling errors example apology and explanation](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4376&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here, although it’s clear what the user wants, they can’t give the chatbot the information it needs to fulfill the request. In this situation, the chatbot immediately says they cannot carry out the task, explains why, and then tells the user where to find a solution. We recommend this three-step approach for chatbot responses and for error messages in general.   
## Dos and Don’ts

- Do assume your chatbot makes mistakes  
- Do try to ‘break’ your chatbot in testing   
- Do train your chatbot to tell users immediately if they cannot complete a task     
- Don’t forget to add a disclaimer stating that information could be incorrect

## Overview(Designing-conversations)

#

Use your dialogs to highlight the complex interactions required for your industrial software and then use them train your chatbot to handle these multifaceted industrial scenarios. It’s not possible or necessary to create hundreds of sample dialogs. Focus on the main industrial use cases, user intent within their industrial working environment, and the most common communicative functions required by your users. We’ve added the most common here with example dialogs. Either use these directly if they match your industrial use case or adapt them to your needs.

## Preparation

1.	Collect brand voice and tone guidelines
2.	Design user personas and user journeys
3.	List required communicative functions for your industrial scenario, such as:
    - Explaining step-by-step instructions for installing a device
    - Clarifying instructions that make consequential changes to a system
    - Transferring users to human support when unable to help
    - Recognizing urgent and complex queries
4.	Select two people to read aloud all dialogs to test for natural-sounding and authentic interactions
5.	Edit and re-write as needed until they best represent your user and the chatbot responses they need
6.	Implement using NLP tools

## Assumptions

1.	You are creating dialogs specific to an industrial context
2.	You know the domain and language used by users
3.	You have a clear user journey and personas to support dialog creation
4.	You have your own brand voice and tone guidelines
## Dos and Don’ts

- Do create example conversations based on user personas
- Do focus on industrial-relevant communicative functions
- Do offer users an exit or calls to action to support further actions
- Don’t forget to read aloud your dialogs; if it sounds robotic, it is robotic
- Don’t create lengthy monologues, instead keep responses concise and simple

## Troubleshooting

#

## Examples

![Unhelpful troubleshooting example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4356&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot says exactly what the problem is, but this response lacks empathy and is unhelpful in moving the user forward.

![Helpful troubleshooting example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4373&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot says exactly what the problem is, gives a possible reason for the lack of connection and then provides a solution to move the user forward.

## Dos and Don’ts
- Do provide calls to action when troubleshooting
- Do offer step by step solutions using technical documentation
- Don’t allow your chatbot to offer competitor solutions to their problems
- Don’t allow your chatbot to hallucinate (make up) solutions without concrete resources

## Natural language

# 

## Natural language benefits

### Positive user experience 

![Formal chatbot](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4229&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4) 

Here the chatbot is very formal and sounds robotic. It’s not a warm welcome or engaging in any way. 

![Engaging chatbot](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4231&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4) 

Here the chatbot greeting feels like a real conversation, making the experience more comfortable, engaging and personal.

### Engaging interaction 

![Unnatural chatbot](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4233&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4) 

Here the chatbot is trying to funnel the user into a topic, however, the A or B option is unnatural or not something normally found in a natural conversation with a colleague.   

![Natural chatbot](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4269&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4) 

When users feel the chatbot is responding naturally, like a person would when trying to assist them with a task, users are much more forgiving if it takes longer to reach their requested goal. 

### Situational appropriacy

![Unknown context with generic response](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4253&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4)

Here the chatbot does not know the user’s specific context or precise information about the working environment, therefore, cannot respond as you would naturally expect from your own industrial chatbot. 

![Known context with situational response](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4256&t=DRKhhzuQ0GLGT7D7-4) 

When chatbots understand and respond within the user’s context, such as a worker on a factory assembly line, there’s a higher chance they can provide the right answers and respond correctly to user input.  

### Brand extension

![Brand extension example 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4259&t=iFyIiL2BeRClIbd3-4) 

Here the language used is similar to text seen inside a UI (short, precise and concise). It’s a practical response to a user query which reflects the brand extension for the UI-specific context, but conversational design requires more of an empathetic and engaging interaction. 

![Brand extension example 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4264&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

As the language a chatbot uses is an extension of your brand, its voice must reflect and align with your brand. Being conversational and friendly - instead of robotic and cold - helps brand loyalty and creates a positive chatbot experience.  

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and a branch of artificial intelligence. It focuses on the interaction between computers and humans and creates models of human language. This helps enable a more natural and human interaction between users and machines. For industrial chatbots, NLP models and software learn from user input to develop and become better at understanding user requests, thus supporting them more efficiently in their daily work.  

### Benefits of NLP
Understand contextual awareness: NLP chatbots understand user context, allowing them to provide relevant and accurate responses.
Interpret user input: NLP chatbots are able to interpret user intent and respond suitably.
Provide intuitive interactions: NLP chatbots can better understand and respond to natural language, improving the user experience.
Manage deviations: NLP chatbots recognize nuances and variation in user language and adapt to different queries.
Offer multilingual support: NLP chatbots understand and answer in multiple languages to support global industries.

## System personas

#

System personas act as an extension of the company brand and should exhibit the same character traits. If your brand represents trustworthiness, creativity and authenticity, your chatbot should be prompted to respond in a way that reflects these characteristics. Without system prompting or a rounded personality, your chatbot may respond in a way that damages your brand and adds frustration and dissatisfaction to your customers. A good persona makes interactions with customers and users more enjoyable and engaging, thus boosting brand satisfaction.

## Creating personas

Follow these steps and answer these questions with your team to create your system persona:

**1.**	**Brainstorm essential features of your chatbot:**
- What’s the chatbot’s profession?
- What’s the chatbot’s education level?
- Does your chatbot have a gender?
- What languages does your chatbot speak?

**2.	Create a list of 5 key adjectives to describe your chatbot’s character:**
- Are these adjectives aligned with our brand?
- Are these adjectives clear and easy to comprehend?

**Recommendation:** For our Siemens industrial chatbots we use professional, efficient, empathetic, helpful and polite.

**3.	Name your chatbot to reflect your brand:**
- Do we want a human name?
- Do we want a robotic or technical name?
- Is this a unique name?
- Does it have any cultural or language concerns with regard to meaning?
- Does it sound good when we say it aloud?
- Does the name match the chatbot’s character and its essential features?
- Does it match the use case and industry?

**Recommendation:** For our Siemens industrial chatbots, they are often simply called “Industrial Copilot”

**4.	Design your chatbot icon:**
- Should we use a robot or a person icon?
- Does this icon align with our brand?
- Is the icon simple and flexible enough for all device types, contexts and sizes?

**5.	Decide on your chatbot’s tone of voice:**
- Is it friendly? Conversational? Formal? Humorous? Direct? Intimate? Respectful? Serious? Casual?

**6.	Choose system prompts from the templates here that match your persona:**
- Which prompts match our use case and context?
- Which prompts are essential?
- Which prompts would be nice to have?
- Which prompts are irrelevant to our chatbot?

**Recommendation:** For industrial chatbots we recommend not more than 20 prompts. However, for chatbots with specific security risks, more than 20 prompts may be needed.

**7.	Create sample dialogs**

**8.	Carry out iterative testing**

## System persona prompts

### Getting started

We’ve created multiple system persona templates for you to create industrial chatbots. Adapt the templates to your own users and context by taking as many of the prompts as required for your own applications.

There are two persona templates: a basic set of prompts and an exhaustive set of prompts. The basic template has essential information including name, profession and personality to be used to prompt simple chatbots. The second template has much more detailed and comprehensive prompts for a more rounded and extensive chatbot persona. We recommend every application has at least the basic prompts, however, we do not recommend using all the prompts here. Consider not having more than a page of prompts.

### Assumptions

1. You are creating a chatbot for an industrial environment.
2. You are creating a chatbot that has access to specific [Company Name] resources you have provided (not the entire web).
3. You have a very specific use case for your chatbot, e.g. accessing documentation.
4. Your chatbot interacts with experts and acts as an expert.
5. Your chatbot supports English user input.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do test and retest your chatbot to ensure its responses are in line with your brand
- Do predefine responses with persona prompts to avoid generic responses
- Do create different personas if the bot needs to work with multiple, varied users
- Do base system personas on user research to ensure there is a good level of customer understanding
- Don’t pretend your chatbot is human – it should be clear to your users that they’re talking to a chatbot
- Don’t encourage your chatbot to engage in unnecessary small talk with your users
- Don’t use more than a page of persona prompts – only take what’s vital and relevant from our templates

#### Disclaimer
*Although every effort has been made to create a robust set of prompts, we take no responsibility or liability for any omissions or any resulting chatbot misuse or abuse. Please carry out comprehensive testing on your chatbot to ensure your prompts are implemented, limit liability and safeguard reliability to ensure your chatbot provides robust responses.*

## User intent

#

For chatbots to recognize and establish intent correctly, they need knowledge of the user’s working environment that continuously builds as users give them input. It often requires chatbots to use follow-up questions in order to correctly establish intent and then provide the most accurate response. When chatbots are unable to understand user intent, they cannot provide relevant or helpful responses.

## Explicit vs. implicit intent

When users ask direct and clear questions, user intent is explicit which makes it easier for chatbots to respond quickly and accurately. When users ask more general questions, or even just enter key words, user intent is unclear (implicit) requiring more information. Training chatbots to understand both explicit (clear) and implicit (unclear) user intent is essential to provide effective and supportive solutions.

**User intent: An engineer in a plant needs to install a new gateway**

![User intent with explicit input](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4236&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the user intent is explicit and clear, giving the chatbot a well-defined purpose and goal. The chatbot does not need to ask further questions and can easily and quickly provide an accurate solution.

**User intent: An engineer in a plant needs to install a new gateway**

![User intent with implicit input](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4239&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the user intent is implicit and unclear (at the beginning). The chatbot has interpreted what the user wants and initially provided what it thinks could be the desired response. The user is then required to keep asking and clarifying so the chatbot finally understands intent and provides the desired solution. In this interaction, the user had to work to establish intent, which leads to a frustrating user experience. When we know our users and their working environment, it’s much easier to train our chatbots to comprehend user intent correctly to them the right response:

![Explicit user input](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4246&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here we see that although the intent for maintenance is very explicit, the chatbot knows to ask which day and which zones as follow-up questions to provide the most precise solution. The chatbot used its training to build on the user’s intent to create a more supportive and satisfying user experience.

## Benefits of establishing user intent

**Relevant interactions:** When chatbots understand user intent and provide relevant responses, it enhances the overall user experience, builds trust and improves satisfaction.

**Personalized interactions:** When chatbots collect feedback and trains with user data, they are better able to create personalized interactions.

**Contextualized interactions:** When chatbots understand the working environment, they provide context-relevant responses that better support users.

**Accurate interactions:** When chatbots can accurately recognize intent, it minimizes misunderstandings and helps reduce errors.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do carry out extensive research on user needs and goals
- Do work with your teams to establish and predict user intent with example dialogs
- Do test your chatbot with explicit and implicit requests to assess evaluation of user intent
- Don’t assume your users will be explicit about what they need
- Don’t assume users are skilled at prompting your chatbot

## Wording and terms

import React from "react";
import { IxIcon } from "@siemens/ix-react";
import { iconThumbUp, iconThumbDown } from "@siemens/ix-icons/icons";

#

Use this comprehensive list of common words and phrases typically seen in industrial chatbot interfaces to ensure your chatbot UI is consistent, clear and aligns with our ONE Design Language approach. The words and phrases below attempt to find a balance between representing our voice (open, engaging and authentic) while also not humanizing the bot. This means that the bot responds as a competent expert or colleague without responding as a human with real emotions.

Note: Some elements offer more than one option for you to select depending on your use case.

## Welcome message 

Use any of the five messages depending on your product and use case.

- **Generic welcome:** Hello, how can I help you today?
- **With chatbot name:** Hello, I’m [Copilot name]. How can I help you today?
- **With product name:** Hello, I’m your [product name] Copilot. How can I help you today?
- **With username:** Hello Felix, how can I help you today?
- **With product and username:** Hello Sara, I'm  [Copilot name]. How can I help you today?

- Well, hello! I’m your friendly chatbot.
- Welcome to chatbot. State your issue now.
- What do you want?

## Placeholder text for chat window 

Use these universal, non-specific options to encourage solution and technology-focused input. Avoid generic, open placeholders that encourage off-topic queries.

- Enter your query here…
- Enter a command, question or topic…
- Enter a command, question or topic to begin…

- Ask me anything…
- Start typing…
- What’s on your mind?

Use alternative placeholder text when your chatbot has a single use case.

- Search technical documentation…
- Enter error code…
- Search parts catalog…

## Response progress indicator 

Always use “generate” as the main progress indicator verb with ellipses (...).

- Generating…

- Generating response
- Creating response…

Use “generate” to match the action verb to stop the chatbot responding or ask the chatbot to continue responding without ellipses.

- Stop generating
- Continue generating

- Stop generating…
- Continue generating…

## Speech to text (STT) / voice recording 

Use a tooltip on hover to clarify any recording limitations and tell users how to stop recording.

- Click to start and stop voice recording.
- Click to start and stop voice recording (max 2 minutes).

Use “Recording…” as feedback to show the feature is working.

- Recording…

- I’m listening…

## Asking for feedback  

Use thumbs up and down icons to request feedback.

- Thumbs up icon (<IxIcon name={iconThumbUp} size="16"></IxIcon>)
- Thumbs down icon (<IxIcon name={iconThumbDown} size="16"></IxIcon>)

- Helpful
- Not helpful

## Time indicators for chat history  

Use “last” instead of “previous” and “prior” for time-related terminology in chat history.

- Today
- Yesterday
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Older

- Previous 7 days
- Prior week

## Tooltip options for chat history (from simple to complex) 

1. Chat history stored for 30 days.
2. Chat history stored for 30 days (learn more).
3. Chat history stored for 30 days and then automatically deleted.
4. Chat history stored securely for 30 days. Only you and authorized personnel have access.
5. Chat history encrypted and stored for 30 days. Access is limited to you and authorized personnel. Data deleted automatically after this period.

## Actions for buttons, icons and hover text 

Use the following action wording for consistency within all our chatbots.

- New chat
- Send
- Generate new prompts
- Refresh prompts
- Show more prompts
- Attach files
- Upload files
- Share
- Copy
- Expand
- Collapse
- Maximize chat window
- Minimize chat window
- Close chat window

- Clear chat
- Submit
- Give me another
- Show me others
- Import files

## Example action buttons for industrial applications 

View documentation 
Download documentation 
Download manual 
Export data  
Open link 
Show image 
Play video 
Report issue 
Contact support  Add to calendar 
Book webinar

## Citing sources 

Use “sources” as the text label to indicate where the generated information is from.

- Sources

- Resources
- Sources and references

Avoid mixing terms (resources, sources) and instead label the source format, e.g. website, pdf, etc.

## Chatbot with multiple agents  

Use clear wording to differentiate between multiple bots when displaying output.

- Responses generated by agent X
- Responses generated by: agent X (with agent selection dropdown)

## Punctuation 

Avoid punctuation, such as exclamation marks for buttons, hover text, titles and tags.

- Show more
- Send
- Stop

- Show more!
- Send?

## Problematic wording to avoid 

Most problematic wording involves the bot expressing itself as a human with human emotions carrying out human cognitive processing. Ensure your bot persona has been prompted to avoid human-like, emotional responses.

Use “generating” not “thinking” as chatbots don’t perform cognitive processes.

- Thinking…
- Thinking about the best response…

Avoid prompting emotional language like “I’m afraid…” in industrial chatbots.

- I’m afraid that I can’t help you right now as I’m assessing the data.
- I understand what you mean.

Avoid technical, robotic phrases like “Please stand by…” as these are outdated, passive and unhelpful.

- Please stand by while I process your request.
- Please wait while I prepare a response.
- Please be patient.
- Bear with me.

## Dos and Don’ts 

- Do use sentence casing to align with our UX writing guidelines
- Do ensure the voice and tone aligns with your product and our iX conversational design principles
- Don’t use synonyms to vary the UI wording, be consistent and use the same words repeatedly
- Don’t use “Creating…” as the progress indicator as there is no creative process and is misleading

## Language

#

## Generative AI and language

Current generative models need prompts to ensure they respond appropriately for the industrial scenario they’re in. Teams and developers train chatbots with the right datasets and natural language processing (NLP) components to fine tune and generate suitable responses. This means individual companies, projects and software can tailor their chatbot vocabulary and define rules for sentence structure and task-specific grammar.

### Pre-trained language models
Most chatbots use a pre-trained model that knows grammar and syntax from a large corpus (a collection of texts for language research). It already has linguistic knowledge which means teams can focus on domain-specific data to further refine their chatbot’s language capabilities. With advances in AI and NLP models, teams will no longer need to explain or give their chatbots specific grammar structures or responses. As modern chatbots consider context, user intent and conversational flow, they will be able to generate more meaningful responses and adapt to user input dynamically.

## Wording

### Concise
Use concise and short responses while considering device type and use case. Lengthy responses overwhelm users and take up precious space. However, we do not recommend using one-word responses like “Yes” and “No”. Always provide useful context for informative and engaging interactions.

![Concise wording example without engagement](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4276&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Although the chatbot responds accurately and concisely, it’s robotic, unnatural and does not encourage engagement.

![Concise wording example with engagement](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4318&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot knows to be concise but informative, based on its knowledge of the user’s working environment.

### Polite
Always use polite language such as “Please wait a moment.” and “Thank you for your patience.” However, only apologize when it’s clear the user is dissatisfied or the chatbot has provided incorrect information.

![Polite apology](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4279&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot apologizes immediately, makes their limitations transparent and then works to engage the user again.

### Domain-specific
Use the language of your users’ industrial working environment. If your chatbot is within a power plant, for example, it should be trained to understand that the word “current” means both the present and an electrical current.

![Incorrect domain example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4282&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot mistakenly assumed the user missed the word “status” in their query and provided an incorrect response, not knowing enough about user to answer accurately.

![Domain-specific example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4315&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot knows the word “current” refers to voltage as it’s a domain-specific word that’s often used within their user queries.

## Grammar

### Pronouns
Chatbots typically refer to themselves as “I” and always avoid gender-specific language and terms.

![Pronoun example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4286&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot has used the name and the phrase “my dear” to make assumptions about the user. It’s essential to have inclusive, unbiased and neutral responses.

### Question forms
Use well-structured questions forms in your chatbot responses to clarify user intent. Within industrial contexts, questions help to structure and funnel complex requests, such as PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) engineering, which involves multiple steps and changes.

Chatbots should use questions to engage the user and move interactions forward:

- How can I assist you today?
- Is there anything else I can assist you with?
- Would you like me to …?
- Shall I continue?

For more question examples within specific communicative functions, see the designing conversations section.

### Contractions
We recommend using contractions (connecting words such as it is – it’s) as these sound less formal and more conversational. Unlike in our UX writing style guide, we recommend using negative contractions such as “can’t” instead of “cannot” as these sound more personable and natural within chatbots.

![Using contractions example 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4297&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Using contractions example 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4300&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Although both express the same meaning, using “cannot” sounds stricter and more robotic.

### Discourse markers
Probably the most important language feature to enhance engagement with your users is discourse markers. These are words or phrases that connect responses and express tone, emotion and acknowledgement, such as certainly, of course, right, ok, etc. They help maintain a conversation flow with users and work as natural turn-taking mechanisms to encourage human to machine interaction.

![Using discourse markers example 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4303&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Using discourse markers example 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4306&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Using discourse markers example 3](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4309&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

![Using discourse markers example 4](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4312&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

## Punctuation

We recommend a minimal approach to punctuation in terms of how chatbots use it and the level expected by users’ queries. Unnecessary punctuation, such as excessive exclamation marks, add to our users’ cognitive load (see example below).

![Using too much punctuation example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4288&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

## Emojis

Although emojis are used in many chatbots to enhance communications to add some emotion and tone to their responses, they are more appropriate for social media and messaging. Using emojis in industrial settings can be seen as minimizing the work and environment of the user. Consequently, we do not recommend using emojis at all for industrial software applications.

![Unprofessional example of emoji use](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4291&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here if the chatbot is assisting with technical troubleshooting in a manufacturing plant, and a worker is reporting an issue with a manufacturing machine, this undermines the seriousness of the situation.

![Professional response example without emojis](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4294&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the response is more concise, professional and shows the chatbot is aware of the working environment and the seriousness of the situation.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use your brand’s voice rules to shape your chatbot voice
- Do work with developers to support data set collection
- Don’t assume your users write correctly or accurately
- Don’t forget to implement new NLP models as they advance

## Overview Conversational design

# 

## Conversational design benefits
- **User satisfaction and engagement:** Great conversation design creates authentic experiences between you and your users.
- **Cost-effective:** Good chatbots reduce the need for customer service, live support staff and support lines.
- **Meaningful interactions:** Designing appropriate conversations for your users and their work environment supports their daily workflow and tasks.
- **Real-time communication:** Accessing expert support when using our industrial software in real time, without delay, allows users to work without interruption.
- **User engagement:** Conversation design creates real-life interactions with our users, boosting engagement.
- **Brand loyalty:** Well-designed conversations lead to positive user experiences and satisfied customers, creating trust and brand loyalty.

## Conversational design in industrial applications
Industrial chatbots should be designed to enhance productivity without disrupting existing workflows or interrupting users. Within industrial environments, chatbots face challenges, but also provide unique opportunities due to their context and use cases. Considering the pros and cons below can help you decide whether a chatbot is suitable for your users and your industrial software applications. 

### Complex industrial processes
- **Challenge:** Chatbots within industries are difficult to integrate into existing or legacy systems and need to be able to support complex processes.  
- **Opportunity:** Chatbots integrated into complex legacy systems can be designed to automate tasks which have long been seen as time-consuming and inefficient. 

### Data security
- **Challenge:** Chatbots must be able to protect their customer’s sensitive data by providing data encryption, access controls and vulnerability assessments.  
- **Opportunity:** Secure and trustworthy chatbots build user trust and boost customer satisfaction.

### Domain knowledge
- **Challenge:** Industrial chatbots are unlikely to be effective without domain experts prompting the chatbot persona and curating the resources they use to support their users. 
- **Opportunity:** Lean industrial use cases make it easier for experts to create domain-specific chatbots that know the industry, its terminology and complex processes. 

### Robustness and reliability
- **Challenge:** Chatbots cannot make mistakes or hallucinate (make up responses) within industrial environments as their users carry out critical and consequential tasks daily. 
- **Opportunity:** An industrial chatbot that consistently provides reliable solutions become a natural part of a user’s daily routine and make workflows more efficient.

## Dialogs and buttons

#

## Clear title and button options

- Concise and descriptive dialog title: Add user

- Option buttons should describe what will happen and relate to the dialog title: Cancel, Add

- Forms: When asking for user input using a dialog and there is no clear action verb in the title, provide Cancel and Save as buttons

- One button only reflects one action

- Users should be able to understand the choices based on the title and button text alone

- Only use ‘OK’ as an option if you cannot find an appropriate verb

- Title: Add user  / Buttons: Cancel, Add
- Title: Delete file  / Buttons: Cancel, Delete
- Title: Edit details  / Buttons: Cancel, Save

- Title: Add user  / Buttons: Cancel, OK
- Title: Are you sure  / Buttons: Cancel, Delete
- Title: Edit details  / Buttons: Cancel, Edit

## Primary and secondary actions

- Primary on the right, secondary left (Cancel, OK) not (OK, Cancel)

- Primary actions can either be positive (Send, Save) or negative (Delete)

- Cancel, Save

- Save, Cancel

---

## Addresses

## General rules

Use specific text field labels for different parts of the address.

- Number | Street | State | ZIP code | Country

- Address line 1, Address line 2, Address line 3

Ensure special and international characters are accepted for international addresses.

- 12-142 Elm St
- #8C (unit or suite number)
- Straße (street in German)
- VI (unit for floor in German)
- München (for Munich)

Use commas to separate names, streets, states and countries to prevent errors when there is only one text field.

- John Doe, 123 Maple Street, Springfield, California, 62704, United States

## States, provinces and regions

Use a comma between cities and states and other regions, e.g. cities within Cantons.

- Springfield, Illinois
- Munich, Bavaria
- Thun, Bern

Use capital letters for abbreviated states without a full stop.

- IL

- Il.

## ZIP codes

Use the correct regional format for ZIP codes, including any necessary spaces or hyphens.

- 90210 (US)
- SW1A 2AA (UK)
- 123-4567 (Japan)

- 90 21 0 (US)
- SW1A2AA (UK)
- 1234567 (Japan)

## Streets

Use common abbreviations for street types without full stops to avoid visual clutter.

|Full word|Abbreviation|
|---|---|
|Street|St|
|Avenue|Ave|
|Boulevard|Blvd|
|Road|Rd|
|Drive|Dr|
|Lane|Ln|

- British Thermal Unit (BTU): 1
- Nautical Mile (nmi): 8

- BTU: 1
- nmi: 8

Avoid line breaks between the value and the unit by using a protected (non-breaking) space. Use the singular when talking about a specific number and in abbreviations. Use lower case as the default for most unit abbreviations.

- 200 kg
- 20 kg
- 4 in
- 200 g

- 200kg
- 20 kgs
- 4 in.

## Exceptions

Use "L" (liter) instead of lower case "l" only if there is any doubt users will confuse it with "1".

- 2 L
- 11 L
- 2 l

- 11 l

Use upper case "B" to abbreviate byte and lower case "b" to abbreviate bit. Use M for mega, G for giga and T for tera to distinguish from m (milli), g (gram) and t (ton).

- 120 MB (megabytes)
- 120 Mb (megabits)
- 1 t
- 1 TB
- 1 THz

- 1 T

## Empty-state messages

#

## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our empty-state messages. They explain why data is missing, suggest how to populate it, or offer links to relevant tools and documentation. Although not every empty-state message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Example |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |
| 1. | Heading | Explain this is empty intentionally and should be there, i.e. this empty space is not an error. | No projects added |
| 2. | Description | Give a clear reason why this space is empty. Provide context to help users understand the purpose of the empty-state space. | To display projects here, first add a project from your Project list. |
| 3. | Instructions | Explain how users can fill the space by adding links, buttons and suggestions to move the user forward. | Add projects |

## General rules

Use the template when the error stops users moving forward.

- Heading: No zones added
Description: Add zones to your profile to see them listed here.
Button: Add zones

- Heading: No zones created
Description: Add region from your dashboard.
Button: Make sectors

Use clear action verbs to show users how to fill the empty state.

- Heading: No users added
Description: Add users in User management.
Button: Open User management

Use neutral framing of the empty state and avoid making it seem like a user failure.

- No users added

- You haven’t added any of your users

Avoid “yet” or other expectation-related terms in headings.

- Heading: No users added

- Heading: No users added yet

## Dos and Don’ts 

* Do make all messages consistent in terms of grammar and punctuation
* Do make sure users understand the space is not an error or a bug
* Do provide an option to fill the empty space with a button or link
* Don’t overcommunicate about the function of the empty state

## Error messages

#

## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our error messages. This empowers users when encountering errors and gives them the knowledge and confidence they need to move on. For more guidance on error messages with different severity levels, see states and events.

Although not every error message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step  | Purpose | Description | Example  |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |
| 1. | Heading | Be specific and tell users exactly what happened. Effective error messages should clearly describe the issue. | No data received |

## General rules

Use sentence casing for all message descriptions (except toast messages) and add full stops.

 
  - Create zones from your dashboard.
  - You have no new notifications.
 
 
  - Add regions from your dashboard
 

Avoid overcommunicating by only adding relevant, beneficial information to your messages.

 
  - We received your error report and will process it within 24 to 48 hours.
 
 
  - The support team has received your bug report but they only work from 9–5 CEST time at the moment and there is a skeleton crew working over the summer.
 

Provide specifics, e.g. objects, values, reasons and solutions, instead of generic messaging.

 
  - Failed to upload file due to connection error.
 
 
  - Something happened.
  - An error occurred.
 

Use urgent wording to signal serious and irreversible consequences from ignoring messages.

 
  - Immediate software update required to save data securely.
  - Update software now to save data.
  - Contact support by 14:00 CET to avoid shutdown.
  - Urgent: Order spare part replacement by August 31st for valve 532/a.
 

Use the same key words in your messaging, but do not repeat headings and descriptions.

 
  - **Heading:** Bad request
  **Description:** We could not process your request. Check and try again.
 
 
  - **Heading:** Bad request
  **Description:** Bad request.
 

Use the same grammar patterns across all your messaging within your product.

 
  - No assets added. / No dashboards created. / No data downloaded.
 
 
  - No assets added. / You haven’t added any assets. / You have no assets yet.
 

Avoid asking patronizing “Are you sure…?” questions to your expert users.

 
  - Deleting this file removes all dependencies.
 
 
  - Are you sure you want to delete this file?
 

Use action labels that match the action of the message without mixing verbs or using synonyms.

 
  - Close
  - Save
  - Continue
  - Delete
 
 
  - OK
  - Confirm
 

Allow users to go back to change actions and avoid “OK” which is often understood as “Yes”.

 
  - Heading: Unsaved changes 
  Description: You are about to leave the page. Unsaved changes will be lost.
  Button: Exit without saving 
  Button: Go back
 
 
  - Description: Are you sure you want to cancel? 
  Button: OK 
  Button: Cancel 
  Button: Yes 
 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do first classify what kind of message is required
- Do make a record or changelog of your messages for consistency and changes
- Don’t over communicate with irrelevant or unrelated information
- Don’t repeat the exact same wording in both the heading and description

## Non-critical information messages

#

## General rules

Keep messages short and concise.

- Pump 3 cycle complete 14:32.

- The operational sequence of Pump 3, located within Zone 2B, activated at 07:34 by admin 049 has completed its cycle (timestamp 14:32).

Use a professional, informative tone for routine updates and only include relevant information.

- System backup completed at 21:00.

- Don’t worry! We’ll make sure your backup is complete before your morning coffee on Friday!

Use clear timestamps for context, clarity, prioritization and record keeping.

- Motor overload detected at 14:01:15
- Emergency stop activated at 21:03:27

- Notification list: 
Motor 3 overheating 
Valve 7 malfunction
- System shutdown initiated 10 minutes ago.
- Lubrication check due for press machine 2 in 3 days.

Avoid urgency wording as these types of notifications are typically not as critical as warnings.

- System backup complete.
- System backup completed at 15:00.

- System backup done! Open and check now!

Avoid adding user actions when possible as these notifications should not impact the user workflow.

- Sensors calibrated. No further action required.

- Sensors calibrated. Click to check sensors (live link), calibration settings (live link) or manage your sensors (live link).

Use sentence casing to align with our UX writing guidelines.

- System will be updated within three hours.
- Scheduled maintenance for Line 4 starts at 14:00.

Use minimal punctuation to keep notifications easy to read and without clutter or cognitive overload.

- System update on line 4 starts at 14:00.

- Notification: System update! Line: 4 / Starts: 14:00.

Use industrial icons only when absolutely necessary and avoid emojis.

- Line 3 shift schedule changed. See what's new.

- 🔄 Line 3 shift schedule updated. 👉 See what’s new.

## Dos and Don'ts

* Do use an alternative modal if your notifications are too long and cover multiple points
* Do make sure users understand the notification is not critical
* Don’t add multiple pieces of information into one notification
* Don’t insert multiple user actions into short notifications

## Progress updates

# 

## General rules

Use sentence case to align with our UX writing guidelines.

- Downloading assets…

- Downloading Assets…

Use the present simple progressive (continuous, -ing) verb form to indicate ongoing actions.

- Loading…
- Downloading…
- Charging…
- Saving…
- Searching…

- Been loading…
- To be loading…
- Will be loading…

Use verbs before nouns to focus on the action and make messages easier to scan.

- Loading file…

- File loading…

Use horizontal ellipses (…) after the verb without a space instead of adding three full stops (unicode U+2026, Mac Option+/Windows ALT+0133).

- Loading…

- Loading …
- Processing⋰

Use ellipses for text with numbers or the object to show a running process.

- Uploading 5 items…
- Uploading items…
- Processing request…
- Saving settings…
- Saving changes…

- Uploading 1 file

Avoid ellipses to show time remaining and approximate or unknown times as they're status indicators, not actions.

- 5 minutes remaining
- About 33 minutes remaining

- 5 minutes remaining…
- About 33 minutes remaining…

Change verb form without ellipses when possible in buttons with loading spinners to avoid visual clutter.

- Download → Downloading → Downloaded

- Download → Downloading… → Downloaded

Use the correct verb form without using ellipses to show background processes. 
 
 

- Download → Downloading → Downloaded

- Download → Downloading… → Downloaded

Use specific and definitive text to make users aware of what is happening and how long the process takes.

- Downloading…

- Please wait.
- Thank you for waiting.
- Just a moment.

Use informative text and actions when multiple processes are happening at the same time.

- Carrying out tasks…

- Thank you for waiting.
- Just a moment.

Use transitional text to manage user expectations and reduce frustration for lengthy processes.

- Processing your request. This usually takes about 1–2 minutes.
- This step takes a bit longer than usual.
- We’re preparing your dashboard. Once it’s ready, you’ll be able to customize your view.

## Dos and Don’ts
* Do use the present simple progressive (continuous, -ing) verb form
* Do use verbs before nouns to focus on the action
* Don’t apologize for how long the progress takes
* Don’t use vague phrases like: "Please wait."

## Time-related messages

#

## Rules for known time frames

Use a specific time or time frame whenever possible.

  
    - System update on Monday, August 22, 2025: 06:00–08:00
  
  
    - Upcoming system update: 22 August
  

Use the user’s time zone when providing any kind of time indication.

  
    - Failed to synchronize data. Synchronized at 12:45 BST. - System
    maintenance scheduled for Wednesday, August 22: 02:00–04:00 BST
  

When necessary, add time zones with the UTC in brackets.

  
    - Failed to synchronize data. Last successful sync: 12:45 BST (UTC+1) -
    System maintenance scheduled for Wednesday, August 22, 02:00–04:00 BST
    (UTC+1).
  

Avoid generic time-related terms like later, soon, sometime, etc.

  
    - Update starts Tuesday, October 1, 2026: 02:00–04:00
  
  
    - Update starts soon. - Update starts later today. - Update takes a few
    moments. - Update takes a while.
  

Use "will" to indicate certainty and avoid "may" or "might" which sound uncertain.

  
    - Update will take a few minutes.
  
  
    - Update may take a few minutes. - Update might take a few minutes.
  

Avoid adding messages when the process takes less than ten seconds.

  
    - This process takes a few seconds.
  

Use countdowns to alert users to time-sensitive information.

  
    - Session expiring in 04:25 minutes. - Automatic logout in 03:45 minutes. -
    Meeting starts in 5 minutes.
  
  
    - Migration starts in 1 hour.
  

Use consistent wording in the UI and add specific volumes with progress indicators.

  
    - Data volume: 45/300 MB - Saving data… 50 of 300 MB saved - System update:
    45% complete
  

## Rules for unknown time frames

Use a realistic time range or an estimated time window if possible.

  
    - The system update can take a few hours. - The update will finish within
    the next 60 minutes.
  

Be transparent and use passive voice when you need to be unspecific.

  
    - Due to the size of the data migration, it is estimated to take between 4-6
    hours. - Data is being fetched from multiple sources, and the completion
    time varies depending on system conditions.
  
  
    - Due to the size of the migration, we have no idea when it will finish.
  

## Rules for expectations and consequences

Inform users whether or not they can continue working during a process.

  
    - The application will not be available during the update. We’ll notify you
    when it’s ready. - The application is not available during the update. - You
    can continue working until the update begins. - Installation files are
    downloaded in the background.
  

Clearly communicate any consequences related to user actions (or inaction).

  
    - You can only postpone this update once. - An update is scheduled to
    automatically install tonight. - The installation will be updated tonight. -
    Update must be installed before Friday, September 12, 2026. - The device
    will restart during the update.
  

Provide clear, actionable choices for next steps and user autonomy.

  
    - Postpone - Remind me tomorrow - Update now - More information - Stop -
    Pause
  

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do add user actions when possible, e.g. buttons or links
- Don’t leave users wondering if the app is stuck or broken
- Don’t guess unknown time frames

## Toast messages

#

## Best practice template

This section focuses on messages that give feedback to user actions and often automatically close. For system event messages with different levels of criticality, please see the status and event section of this guide.

Although always short, toast messages vary in length and complexity:

* One-line messages briefly inform users about the outcome of their action.
* Two-line messages have a heading and description to provide more context or details.
* Three-line messages include a heading, a description, and actions.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Examples |
|------|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1.  | Heading or one-line toast  | Tell users the exact outcome of their action (for system toast messages, see the status and event section). | Noun + simple past tense verb:Data downloadedAsset deletedDevice deletedConnection restoredScan cancelledAsset not offboarded |
| 2.  | Description or two-line toast | Provide additional, relevant information.  | **Heading:** Maintenance scheduled**Description:** Exchange filer in room 500 on August 10.**Heading:** File 4a.ext not uploaded**Description:** File 4a.ext exceeds 25 MB |
| 3. | Actions | Give users the ability to undo the action or provide a link to further information. | Action verb + noun:Heading: Asset deletedDescription: Asset 4a_203/22Action: UndoHeading: Scan scheduledDescription: Scan gateway ANC_GW February 12Action: Open scheduleHeading: Asset not onboardedDescription: Failed to reach Asset 4aAction: Try again |

## General rules

Use simple past tense verbs to state what happened.

- Assets uploaded

- Assets have been uploaded

Use "not" or "failed to" with the verb to signal failure.

- File not imported
- Failed to import file

- File type not recognized

Use present progressive verbs for background or ongoing actions.

- Update application → Updating application… → Application updated

Use the same verbs and nouns from the dialog and button that initiated the toast message.

- Upload file → File uploaded
- Connect → Gateway connected

- Upload file → File added
- Connect → Gateway established

Avoid punctuation as this takes up extra space and adds to visual clutter.

- Scan finished

- Scan finished.
- Scan not finished!

Avoid adding additional words or verbs such as "you", "your", "is" or "was".

- Maintenance scheduled
- Asset onboarded

- Your maintenance was scheduled
- Onboarding for asset was successfully completed

Avoid generic toast messages, such as "successful", "unsuccessful", "error" and "failure".

- Connected
- Failed to connect

- Successful
- Failed

Avoid using "successful" and "successfully" as this adds to the reading load and effort.

- Connected

- Connection successfully established
- Connection established successfully

## Dos and Don'ts

* Do add extra time when there is an action option
* Do use consistent wording to help users scan toast messages easier
* Don’t use full sentences or complex verb forms
* Don’t add an action unless absolutely necessary

- Add new users to project

Use verbs to start your tooltip and avoid passive voice.

- Create KPI tables.

- Tables are created.

Avoid complicated sentence constructions, e.g. no relative clauses.

- Share with team members.

- Projects can be shared with team members who work with you.

Use a heading with a short description for longer tooltips.

- Heading: Cycle time input
Description: Set the duration of each production cycle in seconds.
- Heading: Log history
Description: View historical logs of machine activity and operator actions.

Avoid repeating text already visible and readable on the screen.

- Edit (as icon<IxIcon name={iconEditDocument} size="16"></IxIcon>) Tooltip: Edit

## Warning messages

#

## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our warning messages. This ensures users clearly understand the consequences of their actions. Although not every warning message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Example |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1. | Heading | Explain why the warning has been triggered. | Reset device |
| 2. | Description  | Provide context to help users understand the consequences of ignoring the warning. | A reset restores the device to its factory settings, deleting all applications and user data. This action cannot be undone. |
| 3.  | Instructions | Explain how users can avoid these consequences and find solutions with links, buttons and suggestions. | Reset   Cancel |

## General rules

Use warning messages only when an action or awareness is genuinely needed.

- Temperature readings from Zone 3 approaching 30°. Check cooling system and ensure all windows and doors are closed.

Use clear, understandable titles and avoid generic warning messages.

- Temperature approaching 30°

- Temperature warning

Provide specific and clear consequences and solutions.

- Heading: Leave without saving
Description: You’re about to leave this page. Unsaved changes will be lost. Go back to save changes or exit without saving.
Button: Leave without saving
Button: Go back

- Do you want to leave the page?
Button: Continue
Button: OK
Button: Cancel

Avoid using words like "may", "might" or "possibly will" when explaining problems.

- Your changes will be lost if not saved.

- Your changes might be lost if not saved.

Include links to help pages or troubleshooting steps to avoid the consequences when possible.

- Heading: Login attempt from unknown device
Description: Review access settings or security guidelines to prevent unauthorized access.
Button: Open guidelines
Button: Open access settings

- Heading: Unauthorized access attempt on Control Panel A
Description: Review access logs and verify user credentials.
Button: Open access logs

Avoid repeating your message in both the heading and description.

- Heading: Pressure in Tank B approaching limit
Description: Initiate release protocol to avoid exceeding threshold.

## Proper nouns

#

## Capitalize proper nouns

- A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or object that is spelled with a capital letter

- Examples of proper nouns in English are Jennie, Edinburgh, and Digital Enterprise Labs

- In contrast, a common noun is a noun that is the name of a group of similar things, such as "pump" or "valve", and not of a single person, place, or thing and is not capitalized

- In the context of industrial applications, proper nouns might be company and product names, tools or existing technical and legal terms

- Avoid making up your own proper nouns, e.g. ball valve instead of Ball Valve

## Siemens proper nouns

- Siemens Corporate Information

- Siemens Privacy Notice

- Siemens Terms of Use

- Siemens Cookie Notice

- Siemens Digital ID

- SIMATIC PCS myExpert, iOS, JavaScript

- Siemens Industry Online Support

- Siemens Service & Support

## Technical terms

- Operating systems: iOS, Android, Windows, Linux

## Mobile experience

import DevicePreview from '@site/src/components/DevicePreview';
import mobileGif from './mobile.gif';

        <DevicePreview/>
      
      
        
        Check out our hybrid example application using Ionic, React and Siemens Industrial Experience on the left.

        Regardless of the technology there are aspects to take into consideration when you optimize applications for mobile devices:
          1. **Responsive and adaptive design** due to different viewport sizes.
          2. **Interaction through touch**, without access to mouse or keyboard.
          3. **Device-specific features** like notches or rounded corners.
      
    

  

## Mobile app development

<DevicePreview image={mobileGif}
style={{
  float: 'right',
  margin: '0',
  marginLeft: '2rem'
}} />

There are different ways to create applications for mobile devices:
- **Web apps** are accessed through a web browser and are platform-independent.
- **Native apps** are tailored for a particular platform like iOS or Android and usually need to be developed in a specific way for every target platform separately.
- **Hybrid apps** are based on web technologies while targeting multiple platforms using a single codebase.

Optimize your web application for mobile devices without any significant technological changes to provide a seamless User Experience across devices and screen sizes (read more about responsive and adaptive design [here](mobile-ux.md)).

### Hybrid app development

Since mobile web apps have some limitations as shown above, we recommend hybrid apps to combine the advantages of web and native apps.

Hybrid apps are built using web technologies but run inside a native container providing access to device APIs, allowing native features of the device's operating system and hardware to be used. A variety of frameworks for building hybrid mobile applications are available today. Some provide User Interface components for a closer integration with the different operating systems designs.

The table below shows the differences of the three approaches at a glance:

|                                          | **(Mobile) web app** | **Native app**           | **Hybrid app**                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance                              | Medium / high        | Best possible            | Medium / high                                     |
| Look & Feel                              | Individual           | Platform native          | Platform native / individual                      |
| Development effort                       | Low                  | High                     | Medium                                            |
| Hardware features                        | Limited              | Best possible            | Extensive (depending on plugin availability) |
| Packaging, distribution                  | Browser only         | Installation, App stores | Installation, App stores                          |
| Offline capability                       | Not supported        | Supported                | Supported                                         |
| Siemens Industrial Experience Components | Supported            | Not supported            | Supported                                         |

Cf. [ionic.io - What is Hybrid Mobile App Development?](https://ionic.io/resources/articles/what-is-hybrid-app-development#h-key-features:-native-web-and-hybrid)

To learn more about how this works and how to implement it yourself keep on reading.

## Using Ionic

Developers have many options when choosing a framework for implementing mobile applications. In this example, we use Ionic and React to implement a hybrid mobile application that can be deployed on your mobile device.

### Theming Ionic

In the first step, we’re going to create a theme mapping between Siemens Industrial Experience and Ionic Framework.

Ionic uses CSS custom properties (variables), just like Siemens Industrial Experience does. This makes is easy to map between the two theming systems.

Here is an example of a default theme mapping: [Repository Link](https://github.com/siemens/ix/blob/main/packages/ionic-test-app/src/theme/variables.css).

### Define safe areas

Most devices nowadays do not have a rectangular display, but often feature rounded corners or characteristics like a display cut-out ("notch").

To adapt our application to this, we need to set [environment variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env#safe-area-inset-top) called `safe-area-inset`. This helps the `ix-application` to layout the frame of your application correctly.

```css
--ix-safe-area-inset-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
--ix-safe-area-inset-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
--ix-safe-area-inset-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
--ix-safe-area-inset-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
```

Additionally, some variables specific to your hardware need to be set. In our example, we use an iPhone with a notch at the top. Depending on the display orientation, it’s required to adjust the safe-areas of some components (e.g. `ix-menu`).

```css
body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary'] {
  /*
  * If the device is in landscape-primary orientation,
  * we need to adjust the safe areas for the menu.
  * The data-screen-orientation attribute is added by the main.ts file
  */
  --ix-application-menu-safe-area-left: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-left);
}
```

The CSS selector `body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary']` is not provided via the ionic framework.
A suitable way to add it to the app is the `main.ts` file of your project. There are two options:

- Capacitor plugin: [`@capacitor/screen-orientation`](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/screen-orientation)
- Browser api: [`ScreenOrientation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScreenOrientation)

```tsx
import { ScreenOrientation } from '@capacitor/screen-orientation';

async function screenOrientation() {
  const { type } = await ScreenOrientation.orientation();
  window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type);

  ScreenOrientation.addListener('screenOrientationChange', ({ type }) => {
    window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type);
  });
}

screenOrientation();

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

At this point, the application frame should respect all areas of your device which are not part of the app.

Use the defined variables to ensure that the pages of your application displaying content also respect the previously defined areas as well.

```css
.my-content-space {
  margin-top: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-top);
}
```

### Application frame layout

By default, the [Application Frame](./../../components/application) provides three default layouts (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) that are automatically applied depending on the size of the screen.

If you intend to implement an app for both phones and tablets (e.g. iPhone and iPad), it may be necessary to configure the layouts which the application frame can pick from.

For apps targeting phones and tablets, typically the `sm` and `md` layouts are suitable.

```tsx
const Application = () => {
  return (
    <IonApp>
      ...
      <IxApplication breakpoints={breakpoints}>...</IxApplication>
      ...
    </IonApp>
  );
};
```

As mentioned above, in some cases it is beneficial to adapt the layouts (breakpoints) depending on the hardware. For example, the layout `md` will be applied for an iPhone in landscape orientation and iPad in portrait orientation.

Ionic provides [utility functions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/platform#platforms) that help to decide which layout to choose.

```tsx
const ipad = [`sm`, 'md', 'lg'];
const iphone = [`sm`];

let breakpoints = isPlatform('ipad') ? ipad : iphone;

const Application = () => {
  return (
    <IonApp>
      ...
      <IxApplication breakpoints={breakpoints}>...</IxApplication>
      ...
    </IonApp>
  );
};
```

## Optimizing mobile user experience

#

## Responsive and adaptive design

Industrial Experience components handle various viewport sizes out-of-the-box. When building a page layout, consider small screens in portrait and landscape mode in an early stage during the design phase.

Depending on the importance of a mobile-optimized UI, decide on a responsive or adaptive design approach:

- **Responsive design**: The layout adapts to the viewport size by rearranging or hiding components. We recommend this approach for desktop-first applications.
- **Adaptive design**: There is a separate page layout for a specific breakpoint. We recommend this approach for applications with a strong focus on mobile.

If feasible, we recommend adaptive design since it offers more control over the layout and a more optimized user experience on mobile devices. However, it requires more effort to maintain different layouts. Independently from the design approach, there are different approaches to achieve a mobile-friendly experience:

- Adjust the page layout (e.g. a column-based layout transforms into a row-based layout)
- Restructure the content (e.g. prioritize information or components differently)
- Hide information or entire components (e.g. less important information or components)

## Interaction

Users interact with mobile devices primarily through touch input. Our web components respond to touch events out-of-the-box.

For your specific use cases, it might be necessary to implement custom event listeners for touch interactions. In addition, touch devices offer the possibility to use gestures like swiping, pinching or tapping.

## Device-specific features

Some devices have unique characteristics that need to be considered when designing and developing an app:

- Display "notch"
- System bars
- Rounded corners
- Different screen sizes and resolutions

When you design and develop an app, we recommend to define target devices. Consider the specific features of the devices in your design and development process, so that all relevant parts of the user interface are visible and accessible. Use the [safe areas](./mobile-app-dev.md#define-safe-areas) to ensure that the content is displayed correctly.

## Angular

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Peer dependencies

Both `@angular/core` and `@angular/forms` are peer dependencies which means they must be installed before iX.

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "@angular/core": ">=18.2.13",
  "@angular/forms": ">=18.2.13",
}
```

### Library installation

Install `@siemens/ix`, `@siemens/ix-angular` and `@siemens/ix-icons` using a package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
    ```
    npm install @siemens/ix @siemens/ix-angular @siemens/ix-icons
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```
    yarn add @siemens/ix @siemens/ix-angular @siemens/ix-icons
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```
    pnpm add @siemens/ix @siemens/ix-angular @siemens/ix-icons
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Import styles

Import the design system styling in your global stylesheet (e.g.: `src/styles.scss`):

```css
@import '@siemens/ix/dist/siemens-ix/siemens-ix.css';
```

### Standalone setup

Standalone setup is a little different to module setup. Instead of importing the `IxModule` in your module file, iX components and necessary directives are directly imported from `@siemens/ix-angular/standalone` in your component file.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { IxButton, IxDropdown, IxDropdownItem, IxDropdownTriggerDirective } from '@siemens/ix-angular/standalone';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'standalone-example',
  imports: [IxButton, IxDropdown, IxDropdownItem, IxDropdownTriggerDirective],

```
:::info
When using iX form components in an Angular standalone setup, we recommend importing the appropriate value accessor directives from `@siemens/ix-angular/standalone` and include them in your component’s imports array (refer to preview examples). This prevents `No value accessor` errors.

Available value accessors:
- `IxTextValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-input`, `ix-number-input`, `ix-textarea`
- `IxSelectValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-select`
- `IxRadioValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-radio`
- `IxBooleanValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-checkbox`, `ix-toggle`
- `IxDateValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-date-input`
- `IxTimeValueAccessorDirective` - For `ix-time-input`

:::

### Module setup (legacy)

Import `IxModule` and `BrowserAnimationsModule` (in some cases also the `RouterModule.forRoot([/** your routes **/])`) in your application module.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { IxModule } from '@siemens/ix-angular';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, IxModule.forRoot(), BrowserAnimationsModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In order to prevent certain XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks a [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) can be implemented.
Depending on the CSP configuration in place inline styles and scripts can be forbidden.
By applying a [CSP nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) such elements can be explicitly allowed even if they would violate the CSP otherwise.

With version 3 the Web Component compiler Stencil (used to build all of our components) introduced support for CSP nonces.
For details on how to use them please read the [official Stencil docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/csp-nonce) on the topic.

## Build with AI

## Overview

- Local MCP server installation includes all design system documentation, component APIs, examples
  and icon information
- MCP server integration with your AI agent setup of choice, integrated into your IDE, e.g.
  GitHub Copilot agent integration within VS Code with project-related MCP configuration
- Use cases include (but are not limited to):
  - Get design system best practice information
  - Export components
  - Review project text according to UX writing guidelines
  - Generate new pages using design system components
  - Add and modify pages

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (20+ recommended)
- Access the API [https://api.siemens.com/llm](https://api.siemens.com) by creating a free token
  at [https://my.siemens.com](https://my.siemens.com) with `llm` scope. We use the `embeddings` API. Currently, Siemens access is
  required to request a token, but we are working on a configurable alternative for all users.
- IDE/Agent/LLM setup of your choice, e.g. VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Version selection

iX builds the components for multiple technology stacks. We ship MCP packages for every technology stack and
you need to install the npm package related to your ix package.

- For `@siemens/ix` use `@siemens/ix-mcp`
- For `@siemens/ix-angular` use `@siemens/ix-mcp-angular`
- For `@siemens/ix-react` use `@siemens/ix-mcp-react`
- For `@siemens/ix-vue` use `@siemens/ix-mcp-vue`

In the next sections, the instructions only for `@siemens/ix-mcp` are provided. You need to replace it with your technology
stack if needed.

We distribute a MCP server package `@siemens/ix-mcp` for every `@siemens/ix` version. The version of
`@siemens/ix-mcp` must match your version of `@siemens/ix`. The version number of the MCP package
`@siemens/ix-mcp` is a combination of the `@siemens/ix` version and the version of the MCP code.

For example, `@siemens/ix-mcp@4.0.0-v.1.4.8` comes with the data of `@siemens/ix@4.0.0` and
`v.1.4.8` is the version of the MCP script.

To facilitate the version selection, we use
[npm distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-dist-tag) `@ix<version>` that match
the version of `@siemens/ix`. When using the corresponding distribution tag on installation, you get
the latest version of the MCP package that matches your `@siemens/ix` version and simplifies
handling in your `package.json`.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@siemens/ix": "4.0.0",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@siemens/ix-mcp": "4.0.0-v.1.4.8",
  }
```

New MCP package versions on the same `ix` version are incremented like `4.0.0-v.1.4.9`,
`4.0.0-v.1.4.10`, `4.0.0-v.1.5.0`.

### Project installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.0.0

# Or with yarn
yarn add -D --exact @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.0.0
```

### Global installation

```bash
npm install -g @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.0.0
```

### Upgrading

Simply install the tag for your version and framework again:

```bash
# in project
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.1.0

# with yarn
yarn add -D --exact @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.1.0

# global
npm install -g --save-exact @siemens/ix-mcp@ix4.1.0
```

## Quick Start

After a local project or global package installation, initialize the MCP server and
provide the access token.

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Run initial setup**:

   ```bash
   npx @siemens/ix-mcp init
   ```

   Or if token is already set up:

   ```bash
   npx @siemens/ix-mcp setup
   ```

   > Important: Run this command in the root of every project where you want to use the MCP server.

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter your LLM token from [https://my.siemens.com/](https://my.siemens.com/) (requires 'llm' scope)
   - Use this token to generate embeddings for a semantic search of the documentation. The
     embeddings help find relevant documentation chunks, but your AI tool (e.g.,
     GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) provides the actual LLM (language model) that
     processes your queries and generates responses separately.
   - Choose which tools to configure (VS Code, Cline, Zed, etc.).
   - Optionally set up iX instruction files for AI agents.
   - The tool creates the MCP configuration files based on your selection. Commit the local
     configuration to share it (make sure it isn't ignored by `.gitignore`).

4. **Restart your AI tools** (VS Code, Cline, Zed, etc.)
   - Ensure the server is running and trust the MCP server, e.g. click the "Server" icon in the
     GitHub Copilot Chat panel in VS Code.
   - **For GitHub Copilot in VS Code**: Make sure you are in Agent Mode not Chat Mode. Use models
     like **Claude Sonnet 4.5**.

5. **Start prompting**:
   - "How do I use the search component from @siemens/ix?"
   - "Show me examples of @siemens/charts-ng usage"
   - "Implement a dashboard with different widgets"
   - "Find icons related to AI or machine learning"
   - "Review the texts of this project"

> The MCP server starts automatically when your AI tools need it.

## Setup options

During `init` or `setup`, select which configuration(s) to create:

- **Local VS Code / GitHub Copilot (repository)** creates a VS Code MCP configuration file at
  `.vscode/mcp.json` in the current repository
- **Cline global settings** updates global Cline MCP configuration
- **VS Code / GitHub Copilot global config** writes user-level MCP config
- **Zed global settings** configures Zed editor / agent MCP

## AI agent instructions (optional)

After MCP configuration, set up iX instruction files so AI agents work more effectively with
your codebase. Do this in each repository where you want instructions.

For this, you have two options:

- **Symbolic link to receive updates**  
  Keeps files synced with the installed package. Requires the package to remain installed and may
  not work on all systems or package managers. The tool can create symlinks automatically;
  otherwise, create links yourself pointing to the installed package's `AGENTS.md` and iX
  instructions.

- **Copy the content** Copy the contents of the package’s `AGENTS.md` into one of the following in
  your repo:
  - `.github/instructions/ix.instructions.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

If you prefer manual copy, open the package’s `AGENTS.md`, then paste it into your chosen file and
commit it. Repeat per repository whenever you want to update the instructions.

## Logging

By default, the server performs no logging, but you can enable local-only logging of all search queries and
retrieval results during setup.

### Manually enabling logging

In your MCP configuration add the flag `--log` to log all search queries and retrieval results to
local log files in `~/.ix-mcp`.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "@siemens/ix-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@siemens/ix-mcp", "--log"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing and sharing logs

To view logs, use the `npx @siemens/ix-mcp log` command, select any relevant session and look at the
output or the files copied to your current working directory.

To help us improve the MCP agent, please send us feedback regarding your MCP and agent results by creating an issue at
[https://code.siemens.com/ux/sdl-mcp/issues](https://code.siemens.com/ux/sdl-mcp/issues), share your
information, and include the relevant logs.

## Usage

### Commands

#### Init (first-time setup)

Complete initial setup: configure token and create all MCP configurations.

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp init
```

#### Setup (update configurations)

Create or update MCP configuration files for your tools (uses existing token).

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp setup
```

#### Setup token

Set or update only the LLM token in the system keychain.

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp setup-token
```

#### Check

Verify your installation and configuration.

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp check
```

#### Test

Test the MCP server with a sample query.

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp test
```

#### Log

Check your previous MCP retrieval logs (if enabled / not disabled).

```bash
npx @siemens/ix-mcp log
```

### Use within WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you're using WSL, you need to configure the LLM token using environment variables instead of the
system keychain. Before running any commands, add the following to a `.env` file in the project root
(if you're using project installation):

```
SDL_MCP_TOKEN_ENV=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
```

Make sure the `.env` file is in your `.gitignore` and can't be committed.

Alternatively, or if you're using global installation, add these to your shell profile
(`~/.zprofile` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
export SDL_MCP_TOKEN_ENV=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
```

### Connection issues

- Verify that the MCP server is running (it should start automatically)
- Restart your AI tool after configuration changes
- Verify your LLM token is valid at [https://my.siemens.com/](https://my.siemens.com/)

## Manual configuration

If you prefer to set up the configurations manually, here are the required files and their contents.

### VS Code (.vscode/mcp.json or user/mcp.json)

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "@siemens/ix-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@siemens/ix-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cline (global Cline MCP settings)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@siemens/ix-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@siemens/ix-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Zed (global Zed settings)

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "@siemens/ix-mcp": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "<path-to-npx, run which/where npx to find>",
      "args": ["@siemens/ix-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration from UXT 2.7.0

import Accordion from '@site/src/components/Accordion';

#

:::info

For the full experience, please use the Siemens Industrial Experience components. The theme is intended for a quick, yet, incomplete switch from UXT as a legacy design system.

:::

## Usage

1. Download the [Brand CSS theme](https://code.siemens.com/siemens-ix/ix-brand-theme/-/tree/main/uxt) and import it into your project. Note that it’s available exclusively for Siemens AG products. For non Siemens AG products please [contact us](./../support/contact-us.md).
2. Apply the class `.ix` to the `.uxt-defaults` element.
3. Depending if you want to use the dark or light theme, add `.uxt-ix-theme-dark` or `.uxt-ix-theme-light` to your `body` element.

In the end, your setup should look like this:

```
<body class="uxt-ix-theme-dark">
  ...
  
  ...
</body>
```

```
<body class="uxt-ix-theme-light">
  ...
  
  ...
</body>
```

**Note**: We recommend using the CSS theme with UXT V2.7.0

Your layout might change in some places when applying the theme, including:

1. Headings are notably smaller
2. Buttons are slightly wider because of the bold label

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="I don’t see the right colors." id="colors">
1. Check if you use color variables (no raw HEX or RGB values)
2. Check if you applied the `.uxt-ix-theme-dark` on the `body`
3. Update your UXT version to v2.7.0
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My custom component doesn’t look right." id="custom-comoponents">
1. Check if you override specific attributes with `!important`
2. Check if you added the `.ix` class to the element with the `.uxt-defaults` class, as shown above
3. Update your current UXT version to 2.7.0
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The colors don’t look right in both themes." id="colors-dark" showBorderBottom>
1. Check if you use color variables (no raw HEX or RGB values)
2. Check if you used meta color variables correctly (see more details [here](https://design.mindsphere.io/patterns/color.html#tab2anchor4)):
	1. For text elements: use the font colors, e.g. color-font or color-font-secondary (no base colors)
	2. For backgrounds: use the interface colors, e.g. color-interface or color-interface-secondary (no base colors)
	3. For statuses: use the error, warning, info, success colors (not primary)
</Accordion>

If you're facing any other problems, please raise an issue in GitHub [raising an issue](https://github.com/siemens/ix/issues).

## System icons

Key differences between UXT and Industrial Experience:

- UXT offers an iconfont with 3 different styles (regular, bold, filled)
- [iX offers SVGs](../../icons/icon-library.mdx) with mainly 1 style that corresponds to our bold and partially filled variants separately

When changing to the SVG icons by Industrial Experience, check whether your stylings still apply in your custom-built components.

## Figma library

When switching from UXT to Industrial Experience, use the swap library feature as described [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries).

    The ix-time-picker has been reworked to a new design and now uses different columns with selectable numbers to select the time. Milliseconds can now be selected as well.
    There are also new interval properties to control which numbers are displayed for hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
    Additionally the displayed columns are now determined by the used format, making the showHour, showMinutes, showSeconds properties deprecated and will be removed with 4.0.0.
    The numbers for hours, minutes, etc. can also be selected by tabbing onto the first number, and then using arrow keys and Enter to select the desired time.

    Add new `ix-time-input` component

    The time-input component has been added as well, combining an input field and the new ix-time-picker, similar to the ix-date-input.

## Versioning and releases

#

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases. Version numbers indicate the level of changes introduced by the release and follow the standard major, minor and patch format.

| Release type | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Major        | Contains significant new features and changes, might include breaking changes. Updating requires some developer efforts and includes backward incompatible changes to APIs, file paths, component behavior and/or dependencies. Formerly deprecated components are removed when updating to a new major version. |
| Minor        | Contains smaller features and changes. Updating requires no developer efforts. Minor versions can include components changing their status to deprecated. They are fully backward compatible.                                                                                                                    |
| Patch        | Contains bug fixes. Updating requires no developer efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Release frequency

We follow a time-based release schedule consisting of:

- One major release every 6 months
- 1-3 minor releases for each major release
- Patch releases as hotfixes when necessary

## Support policy

All major releases receive support for approximately 12 months. We distinguish between two support stages for major releases:

| Support stage | Support window | Details                                        |
| ------------- | :------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Latest        |    6 months    | Receives regular minor releases                |
| Maintenance   |    6 months    | Receives patch releases to fix critical issues |
| End of Life   |       -        | Receives no support and no further releases    |

Our support policy applies to all components of the design system including the code base, Figma design kits and our documentation.

We recommend always following the active release. When a version moves from the active stage to the LTS stage, projects should start migrating to the new active major version.

## Supported versions

| Version |   Status    | Released     | Maintenance support since | End of life since |
| ------- | :---------: | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| V4.0.0  |   Latest    | November 2025 | -                | -                 |
| V3.0.0  | Maintenance  | May 2025 | November 2025     | -                 |
| V2.0.0  | End of Life | September 2023 | May 2025     | November 2025      |

import './faq.css';

#

## System access and use

<Accordion title="What’s the difference between the classic theme and the Siemens brand theme?" id="brand-vs-os">
The classic theme is the default that can be used by any application, including non-Siemens applications. In contrast, the Siemens brand theme is exclusively available to Siemens employees and business partners, incorporating specific Siemens brand elements. Both themes are offered in dark and light modes. Additionally, you have the flexibility to create custom themes that align with third-party style guides.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which browsers are supported?" id="vendor-support">
Although our design system can be used with any modern browser, we recommend Chrome for the best user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which device types are supported?" id="device-type-support">
Our design system is tailored for tablets and desktop computers, not smartphones. However, many components, including the main navigation, are mobile-ready. We support breakpoints for the following screen sizes to ensure flexibility across various devices, even though our primary focus is on larger screens:

- Small screens: &lt;768 pixels
- Medium screens: 768-1280 pixels
- Large screens: &gt;1280 pixels

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build mobile applications with Siemens Industrial Experience?" id="mobile">
With the help of our design system, you are able to swiftly build the user interface of your mobile web app or hybrid app.
Read more on the topic in our development and UX guides on mobile development with the Industrial Experience Design System [here](/docs/guidelines/mobile/mobile-app-dev).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What languages does Industrial Experience support?" id="i18n" showBorderBottom>
Our design system uses English as default, but it can be used with any language. All texts are fully customizable and therefore integrate nicely with third-party i18n solutions, which means your software can easily be adapted for users of different cultures and languages.
</Accordion>

## Contribution and development

<Accordion title="How do I contribute to or report issues in the design system?" id="contributions">
We want everyone to contribute to our design system and play a part in its development. There are three main ways to contribute to or report issues:
- As a Siemens employee or business partner: Post in our [Viva Engage community](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI1ODIzNzc5NjM1MiJ9)
- As an open-source library user: Contribute within the [Siemens Xcelerator Community](https://community.siemens.com/c/ix/30) or open tickets in [Github](https://github.com/siemens/ix)
- Directly contact our team regarding larger topics: [team.ix.industry@siemens.com](mailto:team.ix.industry@siemens.com)
For more information, see our [GitHub Contributing Guide](https://github.com/siemens/ix/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) which has guidance on bug reporting, workflow issues and suggesting enhancements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I request new components?" id="feature-requests">
Absolutely! Please add requests for the future in [Github](https://github.com/siemens/ix) or [Siemens Xcelerator Community](https://community.siemens.com/c/ix/30).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I detect when iX components are ready?" id="component-ready">
iX components receive a `hydrated` class when they’re fully initialized. Use the `componentOnReady()` method to wait for hydration:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('ix-button');
if (button) {
  button.componentOnReady().then(() => {
    console.log('Button is ready');
    // Your initialization code here
  });
}
```

For multiple components:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('ix-button');
const input = document.querySelector('ix-input');

const elements = [button, input].filter(Boolean);

if (elements.length > 0) {
  Promise.all(elements.map(el => el.componentOnReady())).then(() => {
    console.log('All components are ready');
  });
}
```
:::info
The `appload` event mentioned in Stencil documentation is not available in iX. Use `componentOnReady()` instead.
:::

Learn more in the [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/api#componentonready).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I prevent flash of undefined custom elements (FOUCE)?" id="fouce-prevention" showBorderBottom>
Flash of Undefined Custom Elements (FOUCE) occurs when custom elements briefly appear unstyled before hydration. Use the `hydrated` class to prevent this:

```css
/* Hide specific components until hydrated */
ix-button:not(.hydrated),
ix-icon:not(.hydrated),
ix-input:not(.hydrated) {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/* Or hide all ix-elements */
*[class*="ix-"]:not(.hydrated) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```
</Accordion>

## Customization and framework Support

<Accordion title="How do I use custom icons?" id="custom-icons">
The steps to incorporate your own custom SVG icon are found under the developing tab, in [Industrial Experience documentation](/docs/icons/developing-with-icons#integrate-external-icons). There is also a guide for designing new icons based on the Industrial Experience (brand) style.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can’t I customize my components?" id="component-customization">
Users are free to utilize open-source libraries at their discretion. However, customizing components may prevent future updates of our libraries from being applied to your software. Industrial Experience is built on the Web Component standard, encapsulating components in a local Shadow DOM. This prevents external styling from affecting the components, ensuring that future updates remain compatible and do not break your software due to custom styling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What kind of framework support is there?" id="framework-support">
Our design system is built with plain Web Components and is, therefore, framework agnostic. For better integration, we provide support for some of the most popular web development frameworks in Angular, React and Vue. You can find more information about our frameworks [here](/docs/home/overview#development-frameworks).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does open source mean within our design system?" id="open-source" showBorderBottom>
Our codebase is openly and freely accessible for anyone to view, modify and distribute. We want to foster collaboration and innovation by allowing developers, designers and UX writers from around the world to contribute improvements and new features, leading to a more robust and versatile platform. We hope that this openness enhances digitalization while enabling rapid development and adaptation to new technologies.
</Accordion>

## Files, documentation and accessibility

<Accordion title="Where are the component Figma files and how can I access them?" id="figma-files">
[Here](/docs/home/overview#figma-library) you will find information on how to get Figma and how to access the most important Industrial Experience libraries. Remember, the Siemens brand library contains Siemens-specific brand elements and is only accessible to Siemens employees and business partners. For the classic theme, we don’t have updated Figma files, but you can use the code components.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do we meet the WCAG and accessibility levels?" id="a11y-maturity-levels">
We are working towards meeting the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and other relevant accessibility standards. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that our design system is accessible to all users. While we’re still in the process of fully aligning with these guidelines, we have made significant progress and continue to improve our accessibility features. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to achieve full compliance. For specific accessibility concerns or updates on our progress, please feel free to reach out to our team.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the release schedule work?" id="release-info">
The Siemens Industrial Experience design team provides a transparent versioning and release process. For more details on our versioning, release types, frequency, and support policies, visit our [Roadmap](../releases/roadmap.md) and [Versioning and release](../releases/release-version.md).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the design system to build my documentation?" id="docu-theme" showBorderBottom>
The Siemens Industrial Experience design system is intended for building industrial applications. If you are a Siemens AG employee looking to create a documentation website, use the [official MkDocs theme](https://code.siemens.com/code-ops/docs-theme) for documentation purposes. This ensures consistency and alignment with Siemens documentation standards.
</Accordion>

## Designing new icons

# 

## Considerations

Before you start designing your specific icon set for your application, consider the following:

- Make sure the icons you need are not already in the library

- Maybe the icon already exists under a slightly different name or it might be planned for a future release so please double check or ask us when in doubt

- Consider using more generic icons than creating multiple very specific new ones (e.g.: Use the generic "add" icon instead of creating an "add-wireless-device" icon)

- Do not create alternatives to existing icons just for the sake of your own look

- Ask other designers within your company about the existence of an icon, to prevent creation of duplicates

- Finally: Entrust a professional designer with the task of designing an icon

### Technical requirements

Icons in our design system are monochromatic. They will be colored during runtime, depending on the context they are being used in. For more technical requirements see the "Code" tab above.

### Formal requirements

New icons should follow the app icon guidelines below for a consistent look & feel across applications. For Siemens applications it is mandatory to follow these guidelines.

## Icon design guidelines

These guidelines extend the basic guidelines on [Siemens brandville](https://brandville.siemens.com/en/design-elements/icons/ui-icons).

### 1. Icon grid size

- The basic icon grid size is 24✕24

  ![Basic grid](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=801-253&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 2. In-app icon design grid

- Use the design grid component “Icon Design Grid” from the “Assets” library as background for creating new icons
- The design grid helps to limit the icon boundaries to achieve an evenly optical weight of different icon shapes
- The clearance zone (red area) should not be touched by the icon (for exceptions see below)
- The lines represent the boundaries of key shapes or just mark the center

  ![In-app icon design grid](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=801-856&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

- Use the portrait key shape for vertically oriented shapes

  ![Portrait key shapes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-17540&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

- Use the landscape key shape for horizontally oriented shapes

  ![Landscape key shapes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-19334&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

- Use the square key shape for square icons

  ![Square key shapes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-23090&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

- Use the circle key shape for round icons

  ![Circle key shapes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-23091&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

#### Exceptions to the clearance zone

- Icons with attributes: Icons can be enhanced with attributes. These attributes are allowed to touch the clearance zone but should keep at least 1px space to the outer boundary

  ![Exception 1: icon attributes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-23092&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

- Optical fixes: Shapes are allowed to touch the clearance zone to equalize visual effects with pointed shapes or single strokes

  ![Exception 2: optical fixes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=802-23093&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 3. Light weight icons

- Prefer strokes and outlines over filled shapes
- Please provide a filled variant of the icon as well, where possible and potentially useful. It can be used in situations when more visual weight is required. The filled variant gets the name suffix “-filled”.

  ![Normal and filled variant](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=808-23094&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 4. Simple and geometric

- Keep icons as simple as possible
- Avoid complex symbols or symbol combinations whenever possible
- Create icons from geometric shapes
- Prefer sharp corners and straight lines
- Use rounded corners and endings only to support the characteristics of the represented object

  ![Simple and geometric shapes](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=808-23095&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 5. Stroke widths

- Default stroke width is 2px
- In case icon readability can't be guaranteed otherwise, stroke widths of 1.5px or even 1x are also allowed. Before doing that please make sure all rules from section 4 are followed.

  ![Stroke widths](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=809-23096&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 6. Gaps

- Anti-aliasing effects can lead to blurry borders and edges
- Use 2px gaps to visually separate two shapes from each other
- Avoid unsafe patterns of alternating between set pixel and no pixel. In the worst case such shapes cannot be visually distinguished anymore.

  ![Gaps and unsafe pattern](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=809-23097&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 7. Strikethrough, cuts and cutouts

- A diagonal strikethrough is used to symbolize the opposite of an icon or an unavailability (e.g. show & hide, switch off alarm)
- A diagonal strikethrough starts from top left and ends at the bottom right (refers to the crossbar of letter “N” for “No”), followed by a 2px space above right
- Use at least 1px space for cuts or cutouts (be aware of “unsafe patterns”, see 6.)

  ![Strikethroughs and gaps](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=810-23098&mode=design&t=LqIxNidruCmTfYDF-4)

### 8. The technical finish

#### Prepare your icon for integration

- The icon size (including clearance zone) must be 24x24
- The icon must not contain strokes (convert all strokes to outlines)
- Combine all icon parts to one single shape by using boolean operations
- Name the remaining shape “Vector”, otherwise color overrides will not work properly in Figma
- Make sure the shape is set to “Scale” in the “Constraints” settings in Figma, otherwise the resizing will not work properly

#### Integrate in Figma

- Create a component from your icon
- Use a short, descriptive and unique name - also consider adding a project or application suffix to the icon name to prevent naming collisions with other external icons
- "Publish" the document with your icon(s) and it will be available as library in your document assets
- Activate your library in the design document

#### Export for development

- Create an instance of your icon (this can be done in the same document the icon is stored in)
- Resize this instance to 512×512 (target size for development integration)
- Check if the scaling works properly (check scaling settings, if not)
- Export the instance as SVG
- Check the SVG code and remove any title attributes (`<title> ... </title>`) to make sure no unintentional tooltips appear on the icon
- Make sure the name of the SVG file matches the icon name to avoid confusion
- Hand the SVG over to your development

## Developing with icons

import AddIconsPlayground from '@site/docs/autogenerated/playground/add-icons.mdx';

# Usage

The package @siemens/ix-icons offers a large set of icons. It also comes with the ix-icon component that displays them in your application. Additionally custom SVG icons (that are not part of the library) can be used.

Since V3.0.0, all available iX icons are no longer loaded automatically. Only the icons actually used in the application will be part of the bundle to significantly reduce the overall bundle size. As a result, explicitly import icons for correct rendering.

## Icon usage in supported frameworks

### Angular

Provide all iX icons as asset folder via `angular.json`.

```json
"assets": [
"src/favicon.ico",
"src/assets",
{
"glob": "**/*.svg",
"input": "node_modules/@siemens/ix-icons/svg",
"output": "./svg"
}
],
```

To avoid unwanted console warnings, we recommend you also configure the domain of the asset path using the `meta`-tag:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Some other tags -->
    <meta name="ix-icons:path" content="/svg" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Or using the `setAssetPath`-function:

```ts
import { setAssetPath } from '@siemens/ix-icons/components';

setAssetPath('/svg');
```

It is also possible to import individual icons without an asset folder via [addIcons](#reference-icons-by-name).

Then you can reference iX icons by name anywhere in your application.

```html
<ix-icon name="star" size="16"></ix-icon>
<ix-icon name="star" size="24"></ix-icon>
<ix-icon name="star" size="32"></ix-icon>
```

### Web components

```html
<ix-icon name="star" size="16"></ix-icon>
<ix-icon name="star" size="24"></ix-icon>
<ix-icon name="star" size="32"></ix-icon>
```

### React

```tsx
import { iconStar } from '@siemens/ix-icons/icons';

<IxIcon name={iconStar} size="16"></IxIcon>
<IxIcon name={iconStar} size="24"></IxIcon>
<IxIcon name={iconStar} size="32"></IxIcon>
```

### Vue

```tsx
import { iconStar } from '@siemens/ix-icons/icons';

<IxIcon :name="iconStar" size="16"></IxIcon>
<IxIcon :name="iconStar" size="24"></IxIcon>
<IxIcon :name="iconStar" size="32"></IxIcon>
```

## Reference icons by name

Although referencing icons by name (e.g. `<ix-icon name="star"><ix-icon>`) is still also possible, simply import all icons you want to display in your application via the `addIcons` method.

<AddIconsPlayground />

## Integrate external icons

### Technical requirements

- Supported icon format is SVG
- Each icon is a single SVG file, Sprites are not supported yet
- The icon has a size of 512✕512 (width, height and viewBox)
- All color information within the SVG will be ignored
- Remove any title attributes (`<title> ... </title>`) to make sure no unintentional tooltips appear on the icon
- For visual and formal requirements see guidelines tab above

```tsx
<ix-icon name="./assets/my-icon.svg"></ix-icon>
<ix-icon name="https://my.example.cdn.address/assets/my-icon.svg"></ix-icon>
```

### Internal SVG structure

The provided SVG icons are graphic resources whose code is mostly generated by design applications such as Figma, Sketch or Adobe Illustrator. The tools use different export routines, which can also change over time. We therefore cannot guarantee that the internal structure of an SVG will be preserved after updates – even if the icons remain visually the same.

## Icon library

import Icons from '@site/src/components/IconsPreview';

#

  <Icons />

---

## Icon usage

import IconTable from '@site/src/components/IconTable';
import { IconExamplesClarity, IconExamplesStatus, IconExamplesMenu } from '@site/src/components/IconTable';

#

## Clarity and contextual relevance

- Icons should be easily recognizable and understandable.
- Use icons that are contextually appropriate and convey the intended message.
- Avoid using icons that could be misinterpreted or confusing.

Examples

<IconTable data={IconExamplesClarity}></IconTable>

## Menu icons

We use distinct icons to signal different types of menus:

<IconTable data={IconExamplesMenu}></IconTable>

The drag-gripper icon is visually similar but isn't a menu icon and should be used for drag-and-drop interactions to reorder items.

### Example of menu icons

The illustration demonstrates the standard layout, featuring the apps icon in the [application header](../components/application-header/guide.md) and an open context menu for an event list item.

![Menu icons](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7420-16011&t=HOxEXsgRcyJFe982-4)

Upon resizing to a smaller screen, the [layout adapts](../components/application-header/guide#behavior):
- The left navigation collapses into a menu icon in the application header.
- The app switch icon then relocates into the expandable menu.
- Actions previously visible in the application header move into a dropdown, indicated by the more menu icon.

![Menu icons small screens](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=7428-36686&t=HOxEXsgRcyJFe982-4)

## Status icons

- We provide a set of standard icons to convey status.
- These icons follow a criticality hierarchy and should be used with the corresponding colors: alarm, critical, warning, success, and info.
- To ensure consistency across different applications, do not use these icons outside of their intended use cases.

Examples

<IconTable data={IconExamplesStatus}></IconTable>

## Icons within components

- Most of our components come with built-in icons or offer an optional icon slot.
- Ensure consistent use of components, either with or without icons, within the same context.

![Icons within components](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5259-16957&t=ulQZQESQGAMR3uyt-4)

## Standalone icons

- A standalone icon, without textual description, has to be paired with a tooltip that describes the meaning of the icon.
- Make sure a description can be read out by screen readers.

![Standalone icons](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=5259-17161&t=ulQZQESQGAMR3uyt-4)

## Animations

#

## Standard timings

If an animation is too slow it can feel sluggish and disturb efficient workflows. In contrast an animation that runs too fast can be irritating and stressful. Therefore it is important to choose the correct timing for the respective situation.

**default-time: `150 ms`**
- all mouse state changes e.g. normal to hover to active/pressed
- showing and hiding of small UI elements

**medium-time: `300 ms`**
- e.g. moving or fading complex components or multiple small elements

**slow-time: `500 ms`**
- e.g. moving or fading larger screen elements

**xslow-time: `1000 ms`**
- e.g. moving or fading entire screen parts

If the `prefers-reduced-motion` (see [official MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)) media query is set, all animation values are set to `0ms` to avoid any animations.

## Acceleration and deceleration

- Objects should move in a learned physical way, objects have mass and don’t start or stop immediately, they accelerate and decelerate
- use `ease-in` and `ease-out` to accelerate and decelerate objects
- Slide-in movements (from off screen) should use `ease-out` only
- Slide-out movements (to off screen) should use `ease-in` only
- transformations or translations within the screen (object is visible the whole time) should use `ease-in-out`
- hiding or appearing objects (opacity) use linear transitions as there is no mass to accelerate/decelerate

## Animation timing variables

All animation timing values are also available through CSS variables:

```css
--theme-x-slow-time: 1s;
--theme-slow-time: 500ms;
--theme-medium-time: 300ms;
--theme-default-time: 150ms;
--theme-short-time: 0ms;
```

Usage example:

```css
transition: var(--theme-default-time);
```

---

## Borders

import BorderTable from '@site/src/components/BorderTable';

All borders are provided as custom properties.
To access them the `var()` CSS function can be called with the border's name:

```css
.some-example {
  border: var(--theme-primary-bdr-1);
}
```

- --theme-contrast-bdr is the darkest/lightest possible color and should be used in situations where the background color is hard to control (e.g. on custom colors)
- --theme-color-hard-bdr is used whenever the border should be a solid, non-transparent color
- --theme-color-std-bdr has a strong appearance and is used e.g. on input components
- --theme-color-soft-bdr is more subtle and used on cards and similar components or for separators
- --theme-color-weak-bdr is even more subtle and used for separations of, e.g., entire screen areas
- --theme-color-x-weak-bdr can be used for very subtle separations or content structuring

<BorderTable borderName="std-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="soft-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="weak-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="x-weak-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="contrast-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="primary-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="dynamic-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="alarm-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="critical-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="warning-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="success-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="info-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

<BorderTable borderName="neutral-bdr-1">
</BorderTable>

---

## Color palette

import ColorTable from '@site/src/components/ColorTable';

#

All colors are provided as custom properties.
To access them the `var()` CSS function can be called with the color's name:

```css
.some-example {
  background-color: var(--theme-color-primary);
}
```

## Background colors

Use “background colors” on non-interactive backgrounds like screen areas. Background colors are solid without opacity. The color-0 is an exception, it is transparent.

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-0">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-1">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-2">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-3">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-4">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-5">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-6">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-7">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-8">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Component interaction colors

Component & interaction colors are used on interactive elements that often come with hover, active and selected states like buttons, toggle buttons, switches, cards, etc. Primary color is equal to brand color, often used for primary buttons or selected elements. “alt” means alternative and is used rarely, e.g. in date picker component to distinguish between selection start/end and the days in the range between.

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-primary">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-dynamic">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-dynamic-alt">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

“color-component-1” are used on interactive elements with a visible fill like cards. They are semi-transparent to work on most background colors.

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-1">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-2">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-3">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-4">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-5">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-6">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

Following ghost colors are used on elements with an invisible background but visible hover, active and selected states. “...-ghost-alt...” colors are used on alternating table grid patterns. These colors are semi-transparent and therefore work on most background colors.

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-ghost">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-ghost-alt">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-ghost-primary">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

Following colors are widely solid, without opacity and are therefore used only on a specific background color or are used in combination with a border (e.g. outline button, input fields)

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-1--hover">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-1--active">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-secondary">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-8">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-error">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-info">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

Following colors are only used in very specific components like date picker calendar

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-7">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-9">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-10">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-component-11">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Status colors

Status colors are designed to represent different statuses. The following states are supported:

- Alarm (error, invalid, danger)
- Critical (status between alarm and warning)
- Warning
- Success (valid, ok, good)
- Info (information)
- Neutral

All status colors are available for the interaction states “hover” and “active.” Each status color has a matching “contrast” color, which is suitable for placing text and icons on such colored backgrounds. Additionally, each status has a semi-transparent color variant that can be used for more subtle colored backgrounds.

:::info
Please note:
Don’t use status colors for texts as they would not meet the minimum required contrast in some constellations. Use the color for icons or on status indictors or backgrounds instead.
There is a special alarm text color that can be used for texts, see “text colors”.

## Text colors

Text colors are used on text and icons.

- “color-contrast-text” is the darkest/lightest possible color and should be used in situations where the background color is hard to control (e.g. on custom colors)
- “color-std-text” is used as default for texts and icons
- “color-soft-text” text is used for secondary texts, sub titles, labels, hints or placeholder texts
- “color-weak-text” is used for disabled texts
- “color-alarm-text” is used for alarm, error, danger texts
- The “color-inv...” texts are rarely used. They are used in “inverted” situations e.g. text on light background in dark mode.

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-contrast-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-std-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-soft-text">

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-weak-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-inv-contrast-text">

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-inv-std-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-inv-weak-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-alarm-text">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Border colors

- color-contrast-bdr is the darkest/lightest possible color and should be used in situations where the background color is hard to control (e.g. on custom colors)
- color-hard-bdr is used whenever the border should be a solid, non-transparent color
- color-std-bdr has a strong appearance and is used e.g. on input components
- color-soft-bdr is more subtle and used on cards and similar components or as separators
- color-weak-bdr is even more subtle and used for subtle separations of e.g. entire screen areas
- color-x-weak-bdr can be used for very subtle separations or content structuring

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-contrast-bdr">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-hard-bdr">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-std-bdr">

</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-x-weak-bdr">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-focus-bdr">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Effect colors

Effect colors are used for shadows, lightbox effects or gradients.

- color-lightbox can be used for lightbox effects behind modals in combination with a background blur effect
- color-backdrop is used for overlays in combination with background blur effect to provide a very subtle ranslucent effect
- The gradient colors are used for brand gradient effects like in the big numbers of the html error pages

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-shadow-1">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-shadow-2">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-lightbox">

</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-gradient-effect-1">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="color-gradient-effect-2">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Chart infrastructure colors

Following colors can be used to color the infrastructural elements in charting components

- axes = x and y axis lines
- ticks = small separations line with value labels
- grid-lines = horizontal/vertical lines behind the chart
- grid-fill = background of charting area
- tooltip = background for chart tooltip
- tooltip-bdr = border for chart tooltip

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-axes">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-ticks">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-grid-lines">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-grid-fill">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-tooltip-fill">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

<ColorTable.WithChildren colorName="chart-tooltip-bdr">
</ColorTable.WithChildren>

## Chart data colors

Use the following colors for data inside of charts. The colors are only proposals and not mandatory to use. Each color has a related ...-40 color, which means 40% opacity. You can use these colors for comparisons like current year vs. last year, or actual value vs. benchmark value.

Our design system achieves elevation through the application of background color layers, borders and selective shadows to achieve depth and clarity.

:::info
**Important note:** We changed the elevation approach starting with version 4.0 of our design system, so it is only partially applicable for v3.x (see [migration guide](../home/migration/4_0_0/index.md) for guidance).
:::

Our approach to elevation is two-fold:
1. **Background color layers:** Primarily achieved through a system of distinct `color-` and `color-component-` tokens and additional border-colors. This defines the foundational stacking order for static content.
2. **Selective drop shadows:** Used as a separate visual cue for elements that float above the UI, demanding immediate attention or representing a temporary interaction.

When you use it intentionally, you can achieve:
* **Clarity:** Help users understand the relationship between different UI elements.
* **Hierarchy:** Guide the user's eye to the most important information or interactive elements.
* **Focus:** Draw attention to temporary or critical content, e.g. toasts.
* **Consistency:** Ensuring a predictable and intuitive user experience across all applications.

### The layering model

This model outlines the primary elevation levels for static UI elements:

![Layering model](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Documentation-illustrations?node-id=6605-276&t=QnYYtjAA8l2uj4Mu-4)

#### Base layer
- **Purpose:** Main page background for the entire user interface.
- **Usage:** Use `color-1` for the main canvas of your application, large sections, or the default background of a page.

:::tip
Visually separate large sections on the base layer by applying [borders](borders.md) (e.g. `color-soft-bdr` or `color-weak-bdr`). When using our components, we recommend using the available `outline` variants.
:::

#### First-level containers
- **Purpose:** Container elements that need to stand out from the main background.
- **Usage:** Apply `color-2` or `component-1` (which shares the same color value in the new theme introduced in v4.0) to components like cards, side panels, distinct content blocks, or primary interactive elements.

#### Second-level containers
- **Purpose:** Nested containers within a container, e.g. a sub-section inside a card.
- **Usage:** Maintain `color-2` as the background, but visually separate these nested containers with [borders](borders.md) (e.g. `color-soft-bdr` or `color-weak-bdr`). Alternatively, use `color-component-2` which is semi-transparent.

#### Floating elements
- **Purpose:** Elements that float above the main UI, demanding immediate attention or representing a temporary interaction.
- **Usage:** Use selective shadows (primarily `shadow-4`, see [shadow](shadows.md)) to indicate physical overlap for components like [dropdowns](../components/dropdown/index.mdx), [tooltips](../components/tooltip/index.mdx), [modals](../components/modal/index.mdx), and [toasts](../components/toast/index.mdx).

We don’t use shadows that are part of the primary layout flow e.g. [navigation elements](../components/application-menu) or [cards](../components/card/index.mdx).

### Other `color-` tokens

We recommend to stick to the `color-1` and `color-2` model for primary background layering. `color-3` to `color-8` are preserved for specific component use cases and should not be used.

### Interaction states (hover & active)

For interactive elements, additional `--hover` and `--active` color tokens are available. These are applied consistently across all elevation layers to indicate interaction states. Refer to the [colors](colors.md) chapter for specific `--hover` and `--active` token names.

## Shadows

import ShadowTable from '@site/src/components/ShadowTable';
import ColorTable from '@site/src/components/ColorTable';

#

All shadows are provided as custom properties.
To access them the `var()` CSS function can be called with the shadow's name:

```css
.some-example {
  box-shadow: var(--theme-shadow-1);
}
```

<ShadowTable shadowName="shadow-1"/>
<ShadowTable shadowName="shadow-2"/>
<ShadowTable shadowName="shadow-3"/>
<ShadowTable shadowName="shadow-4"/>
<ShadowTable shadowName="inset-shadow-1"/>

## Designing with themes

#

## Selecting a theme for designing

When working with our Figma library, you can apply a theme to either an entire page or an individual element, such as a frame or component:

![Applying a theme](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2232-192&mode=design&t=C6IjeY71MP4uA7vZ-4)

### Applying one theme to a whole page

1. First ensure there are no selected elements on the page by pressing the "Esc" key to deselect them.
2. Click the button with the hexagon in the right panel on the right side of the "Page" section to open the theme selection dropdown.
3. Select from the dropdown the desired theme colors to apply to the entire page.

### Applying one theme to an element

1. Select the specific element (such as a frame or component) you want to apply a theme to.
2. Click the button with the hexagon in the right panel on the right side of the "Layer" section to open the theme selection dropdown.
3. Select from the dropdown the desired theme colors to apply to the selected element.

Note: When applying a theme to an individual element, it overrides the page-level theme.

For more information see the official [Figma documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15339657135383-Guide-to-variables-in-Figma).

## Changing theme variables

![Changing theme variables](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=2232-101&mode=design&t=C6IjeY71MP4uA7vZ-4)

If want to adapt the classic theme to your own brand design, follow these steps to modify the colors and other theme values within the Figma library:

1. Import "iX Components" into your Figma workspace.
2. In the top-right corner of the Figma interface, click the button labeled "Open settings" with a settings icon to open the variables dialog.
3. Within the variables dialog, navigate to the desired collection, such as the "iX Colors" collection located at the top-left corner.
4. From there, change the values of the variables to adjust the appearance of the theme.

## Siemens AG Corporate Brand Theme

:::info
The Siemens AG Corporate Brand Theme is exclusively available for official Siemens AG products, where it should always be used as the default theme to reflect the latest Siemens AG Corporate Brand guidelines.

Siemens AG employees can access the Corporate Brand Theme at [**https://code.siemens.com/siemens-ix/ix-brand-theme**](https://code.siemens.com/siemens-ix/ix-brand-theme).
:::

## How to set a theme

To choose a theme set the `data-ix-theme` attribute of the `<html>` or `<body>` tag to the theme of choice (e.g. `classic`).
The default is `classic` in `dark` mode. To enable light mode, set the `data-ix-color-schema` attribute to `light` instead.

```html
<html data-ix-theme="classic" data-ix-color-schema="dark">
  <!-- Framework related imports -->
  <!--  -->
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The CSS class based theme configuration is still supported, but will be removed in version 5.0.0:

The default theme is `theme-classic-dark`. To set a different theme, change the `class` attribute of the `<body>` tag to contain e.g. `theme-classic-light` instead of `theme-classic-dark`.

```html
<html>
  <!-- Framework related imports -->
  <!--  -->
  <body class="theme-classic-light"></body>
</html>
```

Avoid mixing the class-based approach with `data-` attributes, as this will cause redundant CSS custom properties to be loaded.

## Using the legacy classic theme selector

The original classic theme was deprecated in favor of an updated version that is more easily maintainable for us.
The legacy theme is still available but no longer part of the main CSS file. In order to still apply it to your app, you have to load it manually.
This can be done in various ways.

The simplest way is to use the bundler/loader and just import the legacy styles inside your global stylesheet.

e.g. styles.css:

```
@import '@siemens/ix/dist-css/theme/legacy-classic-dark.css';
@import '@siemens/ix/dist-css/theme/legacy-classic-light.css';
```

If this step is done, you can set the theme name class on the body tag:

```html
<html>
  <!-- Framework related imports -->
  <!--  -->
  <body class="theme-legacy-classic-dark"></body>
</html>
```

- **deprecated** Legacy Classic light (theme-legacy-classic-light)
- **deprecated** Legacy Classic dark (theme-legacy-classic-dark)

## Applying only one theme to reduce build size

Importing `siemens-ix-core.css` will only load core related functionalities, without preloading any theme or bootstrap.

You can load a specific theme by importing the corresponding CSS file.

**_Import CSS_**

```tsx
// Load 3rd Party libraries
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

// Load the core parts
import '@siemens/ix/dist/siemens-ix/siemens-ix-core.css';

// Load theme
import '@siemens/ix/dist/siemens-ix/theme/classic-light.css';
import '@siemens/ix/dist/siemens-ix/theme/classic-dark.css';
```

**_Set theme_**

```html
<body class="theme-classic-dark">
  ...
</body>
```
