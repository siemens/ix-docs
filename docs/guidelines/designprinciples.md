## Guiding principles for excellent design

We've refined our approach into four core design principles to help you make your applications intuitive, efficient and valuable.
- **Simplify for clarity**: We make it easier for our users to handle industrial complexity.
- **Design for flexibility**: We create interfaces that adapt seamlessly to our users in their industrial environment.
- **Empower users**: We use technology to assist our users and accelerate their industrial workflows.
- **Build for humans**: We strive to create products that are beneficial to our users in the industrial ecosphere and to society at large.
