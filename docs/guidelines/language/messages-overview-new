  - The support team has received your bug report but they only work from 9-5 CEST time at the moment and there is a skeleton crew working over the summer.

 <div class="dos" markdown>
  - Bad request: Sorry, we could not process your request. Check and try again.
 </div>
 <div class="donts" markdown>

</div>

Use the same grammar patterns across all your messaging within your product.
