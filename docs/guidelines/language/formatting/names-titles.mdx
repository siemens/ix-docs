# Names and titles

## General rules

Use "First name" and "Last name" in forms and ensure text fields accept names with only one letter.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- First name
- Last name

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- Surname
- Full name

</div>
</div>



Use first names to welcome users to applications.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- Welcome Susanne

</div>
</div>

## Inclusive titles

Avoid gendered titles unless absolutely necessary for your application. Use "Title", not "Honorific", to describe words such as Mr. and Mrs. Note that not all cultures have equivalents to some titles used in the United States, such as Ms.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- [ Mr. | Ms. | Mx. | None | Other | Prefer not to say]

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- [ Mr. | Mrs. | Miss | Ms. ]

</div>
</div>

## Title punctuation

Use full stops for all abbreviated titles in American English.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- Mr. Smith

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- Mr Smith

</div>
</div>

Use titles with full names or surnames but do not use titles when addressing users with only their first name.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- Mrs. Turner
- Mrs. Jennifer Turner
- Jennifer

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- Mrs. Jennifer

</div>
</div>

Use full stops for all abbreviated professional titles in American English.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- Dr.
- Prof.
- Eng.

</div>
</div>

## Corporate titles

Use capital letters for corporate titles especially with the name and use capital letters for corporate title acronyms.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- Chief Financial Officer Teresa Lopez
- Teresa Lopez (Chief Financial Officer)
- Teresa Lopez (CFO)

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- chief financial officer Teresa Lopez

</div>
</div>

Use lower case when titles are used generically (without a name) and separate titles from names with a comma.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- The chief financial officer for the company will hold a press conference tomorrow.
- The project manager needs to schedule maintenance.
- Carol Jones, Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board, spoke at the press conference yesterday.

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- Call the Manager.

</div>
</div>

Always capitalize Managing Board and use lower case for "member".

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">

- John Smith is a member of the Managing Board.

</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">

- John Smith is a member of the managing board.

</div>
</div>
