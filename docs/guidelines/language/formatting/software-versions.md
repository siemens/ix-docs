# Software versions

> Consistency in writing about versions builds trust and helps users easily track updates and improvements. Semantic versioning is often used to align with product and development teams and to communicate versions clearly to users. When this is not possible, a clear and predictable versioning system needs to be used to reinforce the stability and reliability of your product.
