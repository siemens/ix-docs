# Addresses

> In industrial applications, writing addresses clearly and consistently ensures efficient communication and accurate delivery of materials. Properly written addresses and awareness of regional differences help avoid delays and errors, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

## General rules

Ensure special and international characters are accepted for international addresses.

- #8C (unit or suite number)
- Straße (street in German)
- VI (unit for floor in German)

Use commas to separate names, streets, states and countries to prevent errors when there is only one text field.
