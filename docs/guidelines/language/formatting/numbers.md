# Numbers and percentages

> In industrial settings, numbers and percentages are key to tracking performance, spotting trends, and making informed decisions. As there are many ways to write them, these guidelines aim to keep usage consistent across teams.

# Numbers and percentages

## General rules

Write "Number" or "number" when there is enough space within the user interface.

- Number

- Num.

Use "No." as an abbreviation for number with a period and without a space.

- No.6

Avoid using the # symbol with numbers.

- Number 6

- #6

Write numbers as digits, such as "9" instead of "nine", in industrial user interfaces.

## Numbers and punctuation

Use en dashes (–) instead of hyphens (-) for ranges.

- The shipment weighs 50–75kg

Write out the unit only once in ranges.

Use either "to" or separate text fields for ranges with minus numbers for readability.

- 5.245,15
- 2,5 million

## Thousands, millions and billions

Use "K" as an abbreviation for thousand, "M" for million, and "B" for billion without a period or space. Consider variations in other languages and never use abbreviations when there is doubt.

## Percentages

Use the % symbol instead of writing out "percentage" within the user interface to save space.

- 10%

- 10 percent

Use % after the number and without a space.

## Phone numbers

Separate phone numbers into groups for clarity when backend localization or separate fields are not possible.

Use the plus symbol (+) or "00" before the country code and show extension numbers with a hyphen.
