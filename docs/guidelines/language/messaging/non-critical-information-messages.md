# Non-critical information messages

> Non-critical information messages come from the system and keep users updated on system status, operational changes, or relevant events and information.

#

## General rules

Keep messages short and concise.

- Pump 3 cycle complete 14:32.

- The operational sequence of Pump 3, located within Zone 2B, activated at 07:34 by admin 049 has completed its cycle (timestamp 14:32).

Use a professional, informative tone for routine updates and only include relevant information.

- System backup completed at 21:00.

- Don’t worry! We’ll make sure your backup is complete before your morning coffee on Friday!

Use clear timestamps for context, clarity, prioritization and record keeping.

- Emergency stop activated at 21:03:27

- Notification list: 
Motor 3 overheating 
Valve 7 malfunction
- System shutdown initiated 10 minutes ago.
- Lubrication check due for press machine 2 in 3 days.

Avoid urgency wording as these types of notifications are typically not as critical as warnings.

- System backup complete.
- System backup completed at 15:00.

- System backup done! Open and check now!

Avoid adding user actions when possible as these notifications should not impact the user workflow.

Use sentence casing to align with our UX writing guidelines.

Use minimal punctuation to keep notifications easy to read and without clutter or cognitive overload.

- System update on line 4 starts at 14:00.

Use industrial icons only when absolutely necessary and avoid emojis.
