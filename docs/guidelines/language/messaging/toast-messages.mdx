## Best practice template

This section focuses on messages that give feedback to user actions and often automatically close. For system event messages with different levels of criticality, please see the status and event section of this guide.

Although always short, toast messages vary in length and complexity:

* One-line messages briefly inform users about the outcome of their action.
* Two-line messages have a heading and description to provide more context or details.
* Three-line messages include a heading, a description, and actions.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Examples |
|------|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1.  | Heading or one-line toast  | Tell users the exact outcome of their action (for system toast messages, see the status and event section). | Noun + simple past tense verb:<br/><br/>Data downloaded<br/>Asset deleted<br/>Device deleted<br/>Connection restored<br/>Scan cancelled<br/>Asset not offboarded |
| 2.  | Description or two-line toast | Provide additional, relevant information.  | **Heading:** Maintenance scheduled<br/>**Description:** Exchange filer in room 500 on August 10.<br/><br/>**Heading:** File 4a.ext not uploaded<br/>**Description:** File 4a.ext exceeds 25 MB |
| 3. | Actions | Give users the ability to undo the action or provide a link to further information. | Action verb + noun:<br/><br/>Heading: Asset deleted<br/>Description: Asset 4a_203/22<br/>Action: Undo<br/><br/>Heading: Scan scheduled<br/>Description: Scan gateway ANC_GW February 12<br/>Action: Open schedule<br/><br/>Heading: Asset not onboarded<br/>Description: Failed to reach Asset 4a<br/>Action: Try again |

## General rules

Use simple past tense verbs to state what happened.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Assets uploaded
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Assets have been uploaded
</div>
</div>

Use "not" or "failed to" with the verb to signal failure.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- File not imported
- Failed to import file
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- File type not recognized
</div>
</div>

Use present progressive verbs for background or ongoing actions.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Update application → Updating application… → Application updated
</div>
</div>

Use the same verbs and nouns from the dialog and button that initiated the toast message.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Upload file → File uploaded
- Connect → Gateway connected
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Upload file → File added
- Connect → Gateway established
</div>
</div>

Avoid punctuation as this takes up extra space and adds to visual clutter.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Scan finished
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Scan finished.
- Scan not finished!
</div>
</div>

Avoid adding additional words or verbs such as "you", "your", "is" or "was".

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Maintenance scheduled
- Asset onboarded
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Your maintenance was scheduled
- Onboarding for asset was successfully completed
</div>
</div>

Avoid generic toast messages, such as "successful", "unsuccessful", "error" and "failure".

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Connected
- Failed to connect
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Successful
- Failed
</div>
</div>

Avoid using "successful" and "successfully" as this adds to the reading load and effort.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- Connected
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Connection successfully established
- Connection established successfully
</div>
</div>

## Dos and Don'ts

* Do add extra time when there is an action option
* Do use consistent wording to help users scan toast messages easier
* Don’t use full sentences or complex verb forms
* Don’t add an action unless absolutely necessary
