## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our warning messages. This ensures users clearly understand the consequences of their actions. Although not every warning message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Example |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Heading** | What? | Explain why the warning has been triggered. | Reset device |
| **2. Description** | Why? | Provide context to help users understand the consequences of ignoring the warning. | A reset restores the device to its factory settings, deleting all applications and user data. This action cannot be undone. |
| **3. Instructions** | How? | Explain how users can avoid these consequences and find solutions with links, buttons and suggestions. | Reset Cancel

## General rules

### Use warning messages only when an action or awareness is genuinely needed.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Temperature readings from Zone 3 approaching 30°. Check cooling system and ensure all windows and doors are closed.
</div></div>

### Use clear, understandable titles and avoid generic warning messages.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Temperature approaching 30°
</div></div>

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="donts" markdown>
- Temperature warning
</div></div>

### Provide specific and clear consequences and solutions.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Heading: Leave without saving<br/>
Description: You’re about to leave this page. Unsaved changes will be lost. Go back to save changes or exit without saving.<br/>
Button: Leave without saving<br/>
Button: Go back
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Do you want to leave the page?<br/>
Button: Continue<br/>
Button: OK<br/>
Button: Cancel
</div>
</div>

### Avoid using words like "may", "might" or "possibly will" when explaining problems.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Your changes will be lost if not saved.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Your changes might be lost if not saved.
</div>
</div>

### Include links to help pages or troubleshooting steps to avoid the consequences when possible.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Heading: Login attempt from unknown device<br/>
Description: Review access settings or security guidelines to prevent unauthorized access.<br/>
Button: Open guidelines<br/>
Button: Open access settings
</div>
</div>

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Heading: Unauthorized access attempt on Control Panel A<br/>
Description: Review access logs and verify user credentials.<br/>
Button: Open access logs
</div>
</div>

### Avoid repeating your message in both the heading and description.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>
- Heading: Pressure in Tank B approaching limit<br/>
Description: Initiate release protocol to avoid exceeding threshold.
</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>
- Heading: Pressure in Tank B approaching limit<br/>
Description: Pressure in Tank B approaching limit so initiate release protocol.
</div>
</div>

### Avoid asking "Are you sure?" as this is vague, has no context, consequences and causes hesitation.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>
- This action will delete all sensor data from the last 24 hours. Do you want to proceed and delete?
</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>
- Are you sure you want to delete?
</div>
</div>

### Use clear, urgent wording for irreversible actions.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>
- Title: Reset device<br/>
Description: A reset restores the device to its factory settings, deleting all applications and user data. This action cannot be undone.<br/>
Button: Reset<br/>
Button: Cancel
</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>
- Press reset to proceed.
</div>
</div>

### Avoid using all uppercase text as it can be difficult to read and may seem like we’re shouting.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="donts" markdown>
- WARNING!! FAILURE! IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED!!
</div>
</div>

## Dos and Don’ts

* Do be consistent by re-using the verbs of the message and buttons
* Do make sure users understand the warning’s context
* Do give users actions to avoid any negative consequences
* Don’t use "please" with the call to action or options
* Don’t use patronizing questions such as "Are you sure…?"
