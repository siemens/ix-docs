## Rules for known time frames

Use a specific time or time frame whenever possible.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- System update on Monday, August 22, 2025: 06:00–08:00
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Upcoming system update: 22 August
</div>
</div>

Use the user’s time zone when providing any kind of time indication.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Failed to synchronize data. Synchronized at 12:45 BST.
- System maintenance scheduled for Wednesday, August 22: 02:00–04:00 BST
</div>
</div>

When necessary, add time zones with the UTC in brackets.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Failed to synchronize data. Last successful sync: 12:45 BST (UTC+1)
- System maintenance scheduled for Wednesday, August 22, 02:00–04:00 BST (UTC+1).
</div>
</div>

Avoid generic time-related terms like later, soon, sometime, etc.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Update starts Tuesday, October 1, 2026: 02:00–04:00
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Update starts soon.
- Update starts later today.
- Update takes a few moments.
- Update takes a while.
</div>
</div>

Use "will" to indicate certainty and avoid "may" or "might" which sound uncertain.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Update will take a few minutes.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Update may take a few minutes.
- Update might take a few minutes.
</div>
</div>

Avoid adding messages when the process takes less than ten seconds.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- This process takes a few seconds.
</div>
</div>

Use countdowns to alert users to time-sensitive information.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Session expiring in 04:25 minutes.
- Automatic logout in 03:45 minutes.
- Meeting starts in 5 minutes.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Migration starts in 1 hour.
</div>
</div>

Use consistent wording in the UI and add specific volumes with progress indicators.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Data volume: 45/300 MB
- Saving data… 50 of 300 MB saved
- System update: 45% complete
</div>
</div>

## Rules for unknown time frames

Use a realistic time range or an estimated time window if possible.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- The system update can take a few hours.
- The update will finish within the next 60 minutes.
</div>
</div>

Be transparent and use passive voice when you need to be unspecific.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Due to the size of the data migration, it is estimated to take between 4-6 hours.
- Data is being fetched from multiple sources, and the completion time varies depending on system conditions.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Due to the size of the migration, we have no idea when it will finish.
</div>
</div>

## Rules for expectations and consequences

Inform users whether or not they can continue working during a process.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- The application will not be available during the update. We’ll notify you when it’s ready.
- The application is not available during the update.
- You can continue working until the update begins.
- Installation files are downloaded in the background.
</div>
</div>

Clearly communicate any consequences related to user actions (or inaction).

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- You can only postpone this update once.
- An update is scheduled to automatically install tonight.
- The installation will be updated tonight.
- Update must be installed before Friday, September 12, 2026.
- The device will restart during the update.
</div>
</div>

Provide clear, actionable choices for next steps and user autonomy.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Postpone
- Remind me tomorrow
- Update now
- More information
- Stop
- Pause
</div>
</div>
