## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our error messages. This empowers users when encountering errors and gives them the knowledge and confidence they need to move on. For more guidance on error messages with different severity levels, see states and events. 

Although not every error message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step  | Purpose | Description | Example  |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |
| 1. | Heading | Be specific and tell users exactly what happened. Effective error messages should clearly describe the issue. | No data received |
| 2. | Description | Give a clear reason for the error and explain any consequences. Provide context to help users understand the error.| Unable to receive data as sensor is inactive.  |
| 3. | Instructions | Explain how users can move forward, resolve issues, or take action with links, buttons and suggestions.  | Check sensor   |


## General rules

Use the template when the error stops users moving forward.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Heading: No data received

Description: Unable to receive data as sensor is inactive.

Instructions: Check sensor / Open sensor management
 </div>
</div>

Avoid generic error messages or codes; instead provide specific data, value and solutions.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Failed to export data due to a connection error.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
 Something happened.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
 An error occurred.
 </div>

<div class="donts" markdown>
 Error 172.00046ERR
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Give clear reasons for input validation errors to ease user frustration.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Value out of range. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
 </div>

<div class="dos" markdown>
Number between 1 and 100 required.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
 Invalid value.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Avoid repeating your message in both the title and description.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Bad request: Sorry, we could not process the request. Please check and try again.
 </div>
 <div class="donts" markdown>
 Bad request. Sorry, bad request.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Avoid blaming the user with “you” and “your” — use passive voice as an exception.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Value out of range. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
 </div>

 <div class="dos" markdown>
 Failed to delete device.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
 You have failed to delete the device.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Provide specific and clear solutions to avoid making assumptions about user knowledge.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Unsupported file type. Upload supported file types: .pdf and .docx.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Unsupported file type. Upload supported file type.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

If the error is our responsibility and fault, use authentic and transparent apologies (say “sorry”)

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Sorry, we’ve moved this page. Please check the changelog for the new location.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Sorry you entered the wrong address.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Use “please” only for extra or unexpected user actions that correct system-caused disruptions.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Heading: Page Not Found

Description: We could not find what you were looking for.
Instruction: Please contact the owner of the site that linked you to the original URL and let them know their link is broken.
 </div>
</div>

Show urgency with wording, e.g. “immediately” if there are consequences from ignoring the error.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Update your software version immediately to avoid losing data.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Use positive framing and avoid negative and alarming words like “wrong” and “catastrophic”.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Value out of range. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Wrong number.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Use softening words, i.e. unfortunately and avoid negative contractions (“do not” instead of “don’t”).

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Unfortunately, you cannot open this page.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
You don’t have access.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
You can’t open this page.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Be honest and transparent when you cannot explain the error or how to move the user forward.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Something went wrong and we couldn't complete your request. Try again later.
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Operation stopped for unknown reason.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Avoid generic wording telling users to contact their admin or support as this is unhelpful.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Open the chat window and paste the error into the input field for support.
 </div>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
 Send error log to administrator.
 </div>
 <div class="donts" markdown>
Contact admin to solve this issue.
 </div>
</div>
<br/>

Avoid overpromising solutions to errors unless the team is working on the problem.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="donts" markdown>
   Our team is working overtime to fix this for you and it will be fixed by morning.
 </div>
</div>
