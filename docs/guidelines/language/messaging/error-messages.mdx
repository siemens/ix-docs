## Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our error messages. This empowers users when encountering errors and gives them the knowledge and confidence they need to move on. For more guidance on error messages with different severity levels, see states and events.

Although not every error message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step  | Purpose | Description | Example  |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |
| 1. | Heading | Be specific and tell users exactly what happened. Effective error messages should clearly describe the issue. | No data received |
| 2. | Description | Give a clear reason for the error and explain any consequences. Provide context to help users understand the error.| Unable to receive data as sensor is inactive.  |
| 3. | Instructions | Explain how users can move forward, resolve issues, or take action with links, buttons and suggestions.  | Check sensor   |


## General rules

Use the template when the error stops users moving forward.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Heading: No data received<br/>
Description: Unable to receive data as sensor is inactive.<br/>
Instructions: Check sensor / Open sensor management
 </div>
</div>

Avoid generic error messages or codes, instead provide specific data, value and solutions.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Failed to export data due to a connection error.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Something happened.
- An error occurred.
- Error 172.00046ERR
</div>
</div>

Give clear reasons for input validation errors to ease user frustration.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Value out of range. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
- Number between 1 and 100 required.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Invalid value.
</div>
</div>

Avoid repeating your message in both the title and description.
<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Bad request: Sorry, we could not process the request. Please check and try again.
 </div>
 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Bad request. Sorry, bad request.
 </div>
</div>

Avoid blaming the user with “you” and “your” and use passive voice as an exception.
<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Device could not be deleted.
- Failed to delete device.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- You have failed to delete the device.
</div>
</div>


Provide specific and clear solutions to avoid making assumptions about user knowledge.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Unsupported file type. Upload supported file types: .pdf and .docx.
 </div>

 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Unsupported file type. Upload the supported and correct file type.
 </div>
</div>


If the error is our responsibility and fault, use authentic and transparent apologies.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- We’ve moved this page. Please check the changelog for the new location.
 </div>

 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Sorry you entered the wrong address.
 </div>
</div>

Use “please” only for extra or unexpected user actions that correct system-caused disruptions.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Heading: Page Not Found<br/>
Description: We could not find what you were looking for.<br/>
Instruction: Please contact the owner of the site that linked you to the original URL and let them know their link is broken.
 </div>
</div>

Show urgency with wording, e.g. “immediately” if there are consequences from ignoring the error.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Update your software version immediately to avoid losing data.
 </div>
</div>

Use positive framing and avoid negative and alarming words like “wrong” and “catastrophic”.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Value out of range. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
 </div>

 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Wrong number.
 </div>
</div>

Use softening words, e.g. unfortunately and avoid negative contractions (“do not” instead of “don’t”).

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Unfortunately, you cannot open this page.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- You don't have access.
- You can't open this page.
</div>
</div>

Be honest and transparent when you cannot explain the error or how to move the user forward.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Something went wrong and we couldn't complete your request. Try again later.
 </div>

 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Operation stopped for unknown reason.
 </div>
</div>

Avoid generic wording telling users to contact their admin or support as this is unhelpful.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
<div className="dos" markdown="true">
- Open the chat window and paste the error into the input field for support.
- Send error log to administrator.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown="true">
- Contact admin to solve this issue.
</div>
</div>

Avoid overpromising solutions to errors unless the team is working on the problem.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown="true">
 <div className="donts" markdown="true">
   - Our team is working overtime to fix this for you and it will be fixed by morning.
 </div>
</div>
