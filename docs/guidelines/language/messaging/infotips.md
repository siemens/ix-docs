# Infotips

> Infotips are short, context-sensitive messages that appear near user interface elements to offer additional guidance or further context. Infotips or popovers are often triggered by clicking an information icon or expanding a section. For guidelines on validation and placeholder texts, see the password and logging in section.

- Set thresholds
Set project thresholds here. Adjust the value to trigger alerts when the temperature exceeds a specified limit (e.g. 80°C).
- PID controller tuning
Adjust these parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) to optimize the system's response to errors and achieve stable control.
- Schedule maintenance
This workflow guides you through planning and assigning preventive maintenance tasks. First, select the asset, then define the task type, and finally set the recurrence schedule.

Use paragraphs to split complex information and use bullet points or lists for clarity.

 
- Power meter monitoring
Area: Production floor
Present consumption: 120 kW
Peak: 150 kW
Button: Open meter list
 

Use imperative verbs (commands) for instructions and guidance.

- Assign a unique identifier to each physical asset for tracking, maintenance scheduling, and inventory management.
- Define and manage sequences of operations and ingredient quantities for automated production processes.

Avoid personal pronouns (you, we, our, etc.).
