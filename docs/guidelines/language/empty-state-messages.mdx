## Empty-state messages

Empty-state messages guide users, reduce confusion, and encourage meaningful action. Rather than leaving screens blank, they provide contextual messaging and clear next steps.

### Best practice template

We follow this three-step approach when creating our empty-state messages. They explain why data is missing, suggest how to populate it, or offer links to relevant tools and documentation. Although not every empty-state message in a product requires all three steps, aim for this whenever possible.

| Step | Purpose | Description | Example |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |
| 1. | Heading | Explain this is empty intentionally and should be there, i.e. this empty space is not an error. | No projects added |
| 2. | Description | Give a clear reason why this space is empty. Provide context to help users understand the purpose of the empty-state space. | To display projects here, first add a project from your Project list. |
| 3. | Instructions | Explain how users can fill the space by adding links, buttons and suggestions to move the user forward. | Add projects |


## General rules

Use the template when the error stops users moving forward.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Heading: No zones added
Description: Add zones to your profile to see them listed here.

Button: Add zones
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Heading: No zones created
Description: Add region from your dashboard.

Button: Make sectors
 </div>
</div>
<br>

Use clear action verbs to show users how to fill the empty state.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
Heading: No users added
Description: Add users in User management.
Button: Open User management
 </div>
</div>
<br>

Use neutral framing of the empty state and avoid making it seem like a user failure.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
 No users added
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
You haven’t added any of your users
 </div>
</div>
<br>

Avoid “yet” or other expectation-related terms in titles.

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
 <div class="dos" markdown>
 Heading: No users added
 </div>

 <div class="donts" markdown>
Title: No users added yet
 </div>
</div>

## Dos and Don’ts

* Do make all messages consistent in terms of grammar and punctuation
* Do make sure users understand the space is not an error or a bug
* Do provide an option to fill the empty space with a button or link
* Don’t overcommunicate about the function of the empty state
