## Error pages template

We follow these templates when creating our main error pages. Although some of the call-to-action examples are use case-dependent and not always technically feasible, aim for ensuring users can move forward from the error page.

| HTTP code | Heading | Description | Call-to-actions (CTA) |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| 400 | Bad request | Failed to process the request. Check your request and try again. | Go back<br/>Try again<br/>Open homepage |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authorization is required to access this page. Check your credentials and try again. | Log in<br/>Go back<br/>Try again |
| 403 | Access forbidden | Use case 1: You do not have access to this page. Contact your administrator for access. | Open homepage<br/>Go back |
| | | Use case 2: You do not have access to this page. Request access here or return to homepage. | Request access<br/>Go back<br/>Open homepage |
| 404 | Not found | We’re not able to find that page. It may have been deleted or moved. | Report issue<br/>Open homepage<br/>Search app |
| 500 | Internal server error | This page is not available right now. Try refreshing the page or try again later. | Reload<br/>Go back<br/>Open homepage |

Use the official code and definition so users can search for code terms and information themselves.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- 401 Unauthorized
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- 401 Unlawful
</div>
</div>

Use language suitable for all target users, including non-native English speakers.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- This page is not available right now. Try again later.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- An unforeseen server-side condition prevented the fruitful processing of your request. This indicates an issue within our infrastructure, not a client-side input error.
</div>
</div>

Avoid jokes, memes, emojis or casual wording in error pages for industrial applications.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- 401 Unauthorized
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- Hold on! VIP access only! 🎩✨
</div>
</div>

Use sentence casing within the description with minimal punctuation and formatting.

<div className="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div className="dos" markdown>
- There is an error on this page. Try again later.
</div>
<div className="donts" markdown>
- There <ins>is</ins> an ERROR on this **page**! Try again later.
</div>
</div>

## Dos and Don’ts

* Do give users a way out so the error page is not a dead end with only “Try again.” or “Try again later.”
* Do adapt your recommended actions depending on your use case and what is technically possible
* Don’t say your team is working on a solution to the error unless this is true
