## Clear title and button options

- Concise and descriptive dialog title: Add user

- Option buttons should describe what will happen and relate to the dialog title: Cancel, Add

- Forms: When asking for user input using a dialog and there is no clear action verb in the title, provide Cancel and Save as buttons

- One button only reflects one action

- Users should be able to understand the choices based on the title and button text alone

- Only use ‘OK’ as an option if you cannot find an appropriate verb
