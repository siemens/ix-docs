In our design system, elevation is achieved through a combination of layered base colors and drop shadows, creating depth and spatial associations without unnecessary stylistic elements.

## Base color layers

At the core of the layering model are the color-0 and color-1 tokens:

- `color-1`: Is placed on the lowest position of the stack order, serving as the foundational background for the UI.
- `color-component-1`: Is placed on top of `color-1` and is the default layer for container elements like cards, vertical navigation, and panes.
