In our design system, elevation is achieved through a combination of layered base colors and drop shadows, creating depth and spatial associations without unnecessary stylistic elements.

## Background colors and component colors

At the core of the layering model are tokens for background colors and component colors.

- `color-1`: Is placed on the lowest position of the stack order, serving as the foundational background for the UI.
- `color-2`: Is placed on top of `color-1` and is the default layer for overlays.
- `color-component-1`: Is placed either on top of `color-1` or `color-2` and is the default layer for components.
