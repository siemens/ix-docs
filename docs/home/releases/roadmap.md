### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Documentation redesign**: Revamping our documentation with easier access to main categories.
- **Expanded icon set**: Introducing an expanded icon set with now more than 1000 icons, along with a memory efficient way to integrate them into your projects.
- **Unified Figma library**: Simplifying design workflows by consolidating our Figma libraries into one, with easy theme switching between dark and light modes using Figma variables.
- **Tech stack enhancements**: Introducing support for Angular standalone components, direct Next.js support and offering improved component APIs for maximum flexibility.

**üîπ Major release 3.0** in Q1: Read more in our [migration guide](../migration/3_0_0/index.md).

### üöß In progress / Currently being worked on
- **Progress indicators**: Introducing a versatile option to give visual feedback on the status of ongoing processes.
- **Date and time selection**: Introducing comprehensive date and time selection options, including all pickers and inputs with range options for date, time, and date-time.
- **Enhanced accessibility support**: Empowering project teams to build accessible products by improving our components and providing comprehensive guidelines on achieving an accessible app with our design system.
### üóìÔ∏è Scheduled / With tentative timeline
- **Contribution guidelines**: Establishing clearer guidelines for contributing to our design system. This encourages community involvement and ensures contributions are consistent.
- **Tabs with containers**: Introducing a new, more prominent box-like tab component with a container. It lets designers organize app content more effectively and improve user navigation, e.g. with two levels of tabs.

### ‚è≥ Planned / Without specific timeline
- **Enhanced ix-modal**: Improving our modal component to provide a more flexible and user-friendly experience. This includes better usage together with the ix-toast, more styling options and enhanced functionality.
- **Styles and design tokens**: Introducing a new design token structure with clearer and consistent naming for colors. Additionally, providing detailed style chapters on animations, borders and typography.
**üîπ Major release 4.0**: Planned for Q3, see info on [beta versions](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/installation/CHANGELOG) & [release strategy](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/release-info)

### ‚úèÔ∏è Conceptual / Early stage of consideration
- **Updated demo application**: Providing an updated demo application showcasing how to effectively utilize the best-of-the-best components. This demo will serve as a practical guide, helping project teams integrate these components seamlessly into their projects.
- **Chatbot interface**: Developing a chatbot UI to demonstrate how our design system can be used to create interactive and engaging conversational interfaces.
