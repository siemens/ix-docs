## Figma library

Our Figma library contains all tokens, components and blueprints ready for app design.

- **Access:** The primary library is maintained in the Siemens AG Global Figma account. Siemens employees with a Figma license can search for "iX Design System".
- **Guest access & classic theme:** Guest access and the classic (open-source) library are available upon request — please [contact us](support/contact-us).
- **Brand & variables:** The library includes Siemens brand assets and Figma variables for easy theming. See [Designing with themes](../styles/theming/usage-designers.md) for details.

## Development frameworks

Choose a framework to add iX components to your project. Each link includes installation steps and integration notes.
