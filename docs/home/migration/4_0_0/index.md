# Upgrade to v4.0.0

## TL;DR
- We renamed the [button variants](#ix-button) to better reflect their usage.
- Map and basic navigation has been removed in favor of the [application](../../../components/application/guide.mdx) component.
- Drawer has been deprecated in favor of [panes](../../../components/panes/index.mdx).

### Removed map and basic navigation

TO BE DONE

### Deprecated drawer

The drawer component has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. We recommend using [panes](../pane) instead, which provides similar functionality with improved performance and usability. Use this configuration for a similar experience:

```html
<ix-pane
	heading=‚ÄùTitle‚Äù
	variant="floating"
	composition=‚Äùright‚Äù
	borderless=‚Äùtrue‚Äù
	size="320px"
	close-on-click-outside="true"
	hide-on-collapse>
	My content  
</ix-pane>
```

Here is a comparison of the properties and events between the drawer and pane components:

| **Drawer**        | **Pane**             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `expanded`        | `show`               |
| `width`           | `size`               |
| `min-width`       | (not available)      |
| `max-width`       | (not available)      |
| `full-height`     | (not available)      |
| `on-drawer-close` | `on-expanded-change` |
| `on-open`         | `on-expanded-change` |

Additional changes you need to consider when migrating from drawers to panes:
- You may need to adjust your content layout accordingly since pane contents have a default padding of `16px`.
- You now need to define a title for the pane using the `heading` property.

- Replaced `variant` names:
	- `primary` ‚Üí `primary`
