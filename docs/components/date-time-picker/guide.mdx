# Date time picker - Usage

Date time pickers offer an interface for selecting both dates and times, which can be used as a standalone element or within a dropdown, providing a seamless way to input date and time values.

1. [Date picker](../date-picker)
2. [Time picker](../time-picker)
3. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Value**: See [date picker](../date-picker) and [time picker](../time-picker).
- **Single selection**: See [date picker](../date-picker).
- **Format**: Choose the date and time format (e.g. `yyyy/LL/dd` and `HH:mm:ss`).
- **Min and max dates**: See [date picker](../date-picker).
- **Date picker appearance**: See [date picker](../date-picker).
  - **Week start**: Define which day the week starts on. By default, it will be defined based on the locale.
  - **Week numbers**: Show calendar weeks on the left side of the calendar when needed for reference.
- **Time picker appearance**: See [time picker](../time-picker).
  - **Time reference**: Show time reference input for AM/PM notation when using 12-hour time format.
  - **Header**: Customize the header of the time picker.
- **Corners**: By default, date time pickers show rounded corners to be consistent with the [dropdown](../dropdown). Use straight, left or right corners to combine with other components.

## Behavior in context

- **Combined selection**: Users select both a date and a time before confirming their choice. The selection is only finalized when the confirmation button is clicked.
- **Range selection**: In range mode, users select a date range with a single time value applied to both the start and end dates. For different timestamps (dates with different times) use separate date time pickers for start and end.
- **Month navigation**: Users can navigate between months using the previous and next buttons in the header. This allows quick access to dates outside the current view.
- **Interaction**: Users can navigate through the date time picker using the keyboard. The following keys are supported:
  - **Tab**: Navigate between areas of the picker (header, body, time input, footer).
  - **Arrow keys**: Move through dates in the date picker and times in the time picker.
  - **Enter or click**: Select the highlighted date or time.
  - **Escape**: Close the date time picker when used in a dropdown. If the header dropdown for month/year selection is open, it closes first.

## States

Individual calendar dates within a date time picker have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. Dates outside the allowed range appear in a disabled state and cannot be selected (see [date picker states](../date-picker#states) and [time picker states](../time-picker#states) for reference).

## Dos and Don’ts

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>

- Do use date time pickers when both date and time information are required
- Do ensure the date time picker is accessible via keyboard navigation
- Do use range selection for time periods like booking appointments or scheduling events
- Do set appropriate min and max dates to prevent invalid selections

</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>

- Don’t use date time pickers when only a date or only a time is needed (use [date pickers](../date-picker) or [time pickers](../time-picker) instead)
- Don’t forget to validate both date and time inputs in your form logic
- Don’t use date time pickers for dates that are far in the past or future without setting appropriate min and max constraints
- Don’t clutter the interface with unnecessary time precision when approximate times are sufficient
