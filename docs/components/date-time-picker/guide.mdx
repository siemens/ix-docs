# Date time picker - Usage

Date time pickers offer an interface for selecting both dates and times, which can be used as a standalone element or within a dropdown, providing a seamless way to input date and time values.

1. [Date picker](../date-picker)
2. [Time picker](../time-picker)
3. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Value**: The selected date value. In range mode, both start and end dates can be defined using the from and to properties.
- **Single selection**: By default, date time pickers support range selection. Enable single selection mode when only one date needs to be selected.
- **Format**: Choose the date and time format (e.g. 'yyyy/LL/dd', 'HH:mm:ss').
- **Locale**: Set the locale identifier (e.g., 'en' or 'de') to translate weekday and month labels and the default week start.
- **Week start**: Define which day the week starts on, based on the locale’s weekdays array. This allows customization beyond the default locale settings.
- **Week numbers**: Show week numbers on the left side of the calendar when needed for reference.
- **Time reference**: Show time reference input for AM/PM notation when using 12-hour time format.
- **Min and max dates**: Restrict the selectable date range by defining the earliest and latest dates users can choose.
- **Button text**: Customize the text of the confirmation button to match your application’s language and context.
- **Time label**: Customize the label above the time picker (default: 'Time') to match your application’s language.

## Behavior in context

- **Combined selection**: Users select both a date and a time before confirming their choice. The selection is only finalized when the confirmation button is clicked.
- **Range selection**: When in range mode, users select a start date first, then an end date. The period between both dates is visually highlighted to provide clear feedback. The time applies to the complete selection.
- **Month navigation**: Users can navigate between months using the previous and next buttons in the header. This allows quick access to dates outside the current view.
- **Time adjustment**: Users can modify the time using the time picker input field. The format follows the specified time format string.
- **Interaction**: Users can navigate through the date time picker using the keyboard. The following keys are supported:
  - **Tab**: Navigate between areas of the picker (header, body, time input, footer).
  - **Arrow keys**: Move through dates in the calendar.
  - **Enter or click**: Select the highlighted date or confirm the selection.
  - **Escape**: Close the date time picker when used in a dropdown.

## States

Individual calendar dates within a date time picker have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. Dates outside the allowed range appear in a disabled state and cannot be selected.

## Dos and Don’ts

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>

- Do use date time pickers when both date and time information are required
- Do provide clear labels when the date time picker is used in a form context
- Do ensure the date time picker is accessible via keyboard navigation
- Do use range selection for time periods like booking appointments or scheduling events
- Do set appropriate min and max dates to prevent invalid selections

</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>

- Don’t use date time pickers when only a date or only a time is needed, use [date picker](../date-picker) or [time picker](../time-picker) instead
- Don’t forget to validate both date and time inputs in your form logic
- Don’t use date time pickers for dates that are far in the past or future without setting appropriate min and max constraints
- Don’t clutter the interface with unnecessary time precision when approximate times are sufficient
