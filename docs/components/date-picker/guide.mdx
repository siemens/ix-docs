# Date picker - Usage

Date pickers provide a versatile calendar that can be used as a standalone element or within a dropdown for date input, offering a seamless way to select dates.

1. Month and year navigation
2. Weekday labels
3. Week numbers
4. Selected date or date range
5. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Value**: Defines the selected date or date range.
- **Single selection**: By default, users select date ranges. Use single selection to allow selecting a single date.
- **Format**: Define the date format that determines how dates are displayed, e.g. `yyyy/LL/dd` for `2024/06/15`.
- **Week start**: Define which day the week starts on. By default, it will be defined based on the locale.
- **Week numbers**: Show calendar weeks on the left side of the calendar when needed for reference.
- **Min and max dates**: Restrict the selectable date range by defining the earliest and latest dates users can choose.
- **Corners**: By default, date pickers show rounded corners to be consistent with the [dropdown](../dropdown). Use straight, left or right corners to combine with other components.

## Behavior in context

- **Range selection**: In range mode users select a start date and then an end date. The time period between both dates is visually highlighted to provide clear feedback.
- **Month navigation**: Users can navigate between months using the arrow buttons in the header or the dropdown menu to quickly jump to a specific month and year.
- **Interaction**: Users can navigate through the date picker using the keyboard. The following keys are supported:
  - **Tab**: Navigate between areas of the date picker (header, body, footer).
  - **Arrow keys**: Move through dates in the calendar.
  - **Enter or click**: Select the highlighted date.
  - **Escape**: Close date pickers when used in a dropdown. If header dropdown for month/year selection is open, it closes first.

## States

Individual calendar dates within a date picker have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. Dates outside the allowed range appear in a disabled state and cannot be selected.
