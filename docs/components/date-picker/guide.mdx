# Date picker - Usage

Date pickers provide a versatile calendar that can be used as a standalone element or within a dropdown for date input, offering a seamless way to select dates.

1. Date picker container
2. Month and year header with navigation
3. Weekday labels
4. Calendar days
5. Selected date or date range
6. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Value**: The selected date value. In range mode, both start and end dates can be defined.
- **Single selection**: By default, date pickers support range selection. Enable single selection mode when only one date needs to be selected.
- **Format**: Define the date format using tokens (e.g., 'yyyy/LL/dd'). This determines how dates are displayed and returned by the component.
- **Locale**: Set the locale identifier (e.g., 'en' or 'de') to translate weekday and month labels. The locale also determines the default order of weekdays based on regional conventions.
- **Week start**: Define which day the week starts on, based on the locale's weekdays array. This allows customization beyond the default locale settings.
- **Week numbers**: Show week numbers on the left side of the calendar when needed for reference.
- **Min and max dates**: Restrict the selectable date range by defining the earliest and latest dates users can choose.
- **Corners**: By default, date pickers show rounded corners to be consistent with the [dropdown](../dropdown). Use straight, left or right corners to combine with other components.
- **Button text**: Customize the text of the confirmation button to match your application's language and context.

## Behavior in context

- **Range selection**: When in range mode, users select a start date first, then an end date. The period between both dates is visually highlighted to provide clear feedback.
- **Month navigation**: Users can navigate between months using the previous and next buttons in the header. This allows quick access to dates outside the current view.
- **Interaction**: Users can navigate through the date picker using the keyboard. The following keys are supported:
  - **Tab**: Navigate between areas of the date picker (header, body, footer).
  - **Arrow keys**: Move through dates in the calendar.
  - **Enter or click**: Select the highlighted date.
  - **Escape**: Close the date picker when used in a dropdown.

## States

Individual calendar dates within a date picker have multiple states: Default, hover, active, disabled, selected and focused. Dates outside the allowed range appear in a disabled state and cannot be selected.
