# Toggle button - Usage

Toggle buttons with and without text labels are available. We typically use toggle buttons to switch between states or modes. They are ideal for scenarios where a setting can be turned on or off, or where a selection can be toggled independently of others.

![Overview](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=1480-33046&mode=design&t=iUJlfIvOwhKY3qk9-4)

Variants, options and states of the [button](../button/index.mdx) and the [icon button](../icon-button/index.mdx) components apply. Only additional, deviating or detailing specifications are listed here.

## Options

- **Pressed:** Toggle buttons can take a pressed (active) state. To improve accessibility, this state is set via the pressed option so it can be read by screen readers.
- The options **type** and **color** are not available for toggle buttons.

## Behavior in context

- **Independent toggling:** Toggle buttons are typically used on their own or in layouts where each button represents an independent setting or mode. For example, toggling bold, italic or underline in a text editor.

## States

Toggle buttons have five states: Default, hover, active, disabled, loading and focused. All states are also available for pressed toggled buttons.

## Dos and Don'ts

- Do use toggle buttons when users can switch a setting on or off independently
- Do use toggle buttons when two opposing options don't follow the on/off metaphor
- Donâ€™t use toggle buttons in button groups where only one option can be selected (use normal [buttons](../button/index.mdx) or [icon buttons](../icon-button/index.mdx) instead)
