# Date time input - Usage

The date time input component is typically used in forms, filters and scheduling tools to ensure consistent and accurate date and time entries. By standardizing date time input, it helps maintain data integrity and improves the user experience in applications requiring precise date and time information.

1. Label
2. Required field indicator
3. Current date and time value
4. Calendar [icon button](../icon-button)
5. [Input field](../input)
6. [Date time picker](../date-time-picker)
7. Month and year navigation
8. Weekday labels
9. Selected date or date range
10. Time picker
11. Confirm [button](../button)

## Options

- **Label**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Required**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Helper text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Show text as tooltip**: See [form field](../forms-field).
- **Placeholder**: See [form field](../forms-field). We typically use a placeholder to show an example date time format to assist users when the field is empty.
- **Text alignment**: See [form field](../forms-field) (by default at start).
- **Error message**: Feedback text when date or time is not parsable. We typically use this to inform users that the entered date time format is incorrect and guide them to enter a valid date and time.
- **Date format**: Specify the date format, default 'yyyy/LL/dd' to ensure that dates are entered in a consistent and recognizable format.
- **Time format**: Specify the time format to ensure that times are entered in a consistent and recognizable format. Default is 'TT' which is the localized 24-hour time with seconds (read more in the [UX writing guides](./../../guidelines/language/writing-style-guide-getting-started)).
- **Locale**: Set the locale identifier (e.g., 'en' or 'de') to translate weekday and month labels. The locale also determines the default order of weekdays based on regional conventions.
- **Single selection**: By default, date time pickers support range selection. Enable single selection mode when only one date and time needs to be selected.
- **Range selection**: Select both start and end dates with a single time value.
- **Min and max dates**: Restrict the selectable date range by defining the earliest and latest dates users can choose.
- **Week numbers**: Show week numbers on the left side of the calendar when needed for reference.
- **Time reference**: Show time reference input for AM/PM notation when using 12-hour time format.
- **Date time picker**:
  - **Corners**: See [date time picker](../date-time-picker).
  - **Button text**: Customize the text of the confirmation button to match your application's language and context.
  - **Time label**: Customize the label above the time picker (default: 'Time') to match your application's language.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction**:
  - Click or focus opens the date time picker.
  - Use mouse or keyboard arrows to navigate to the desired date and adjust the time.
  - Confirm closes the date time picker and applies the selection.
  - Typing a valid date and time into input field closes the picker.
  - Escape key closes the date time picker.
- **Validation**:
  - Use feedback text for validation types valid, info, warning and invalid.
  - Invalid feedback is automatically provided if the entered date or time is not parsable.
  - Refer to the [validation](../forms-validation) chapter for detailed guidelines.
- **Overflow**: The input field should be wide enough to display the full date and time without truncation.
- **Alignment**: Date time inputs are always aligned to the left.
- **Combined selection**: Users select both a date and a time before confirming their choice. The selection is only finalized when the confirmation button is clicked.

## States

Date time input has five states: Default, hover, disabled, read-only and focused.

## Dos and Don'ts

<div class="dos-and-donts" markdown>
<div class="dos" markdown>

- Do use consistent date and time formats throughout the application to avoid confusion
- Do provide clear instructions on the expected format, such as "Enter the date time in yyyy/mm/dd HH:mm format"
- Do ensure the date time picker is accessible via keyboard
- Do consider localization to adapt date and time formats to local conventions
- Do use separate inputs for start and end date times when defining time ranges

</div>
<div class="donts" markdown>

- Don't use date time inputs when only a date or only a time is needed, use [date input](../input-date) or [time input](../input-time) instead
- Don't use ambiguous formats without providing clear context or helper text
- Don't allow free text without validation or formatting guidance
- Don't forget to validate both date and time inputs in your form logic
